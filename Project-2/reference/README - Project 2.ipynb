    "House flipping - the lucrative process of finding great housing deals, fixing them and eventually selling them at a better price, is gaining popularity in the United States.

    "HouseInc, a boutique real-estate consultancy that specialises in assisting home owners and retail investors in their efforts to participate in house flipping investment activities, as well as passive real-estate investments. HouseInc has achieved broad success in their consultancy services in other Midwestern states, and has decided to broaden their services and expand their reach to neighbouring state, Iowa, due to its increasing demand in house purchases and stable rise in real estate prices. HouseInc is starting off its expansion in the region with Ames, a city in Iowa.\n",

    "As a senior consultant in the team, my task is to perform data exploration and design a house price prediction model for our business development team. The business case for this project are detailed below:\n",
    "1. Data exploration of past real estate transactions in the Ames, Iowa region, would help us to understand the geographical discrepancy in home prices, and which estate to focus on when we search for houses with deep discounts. \n",
    "2. A mathematically-backed prediction model to share with our potential clients regarding our analysis of home prices, based on their budget, preference and agenda. \n",
    "3. Provide useful and sound advice to clients intending to renovate their house for the purpose of selling them at for higher returns. \n",
    "4. Have a good understanding of which materials/styles that house owners prefer in this region through the model so that sourcing for contractors will be more targeted, and potentially cheaper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our business profits by taking a commission from each successful house flip (10%) and a consultation charges for investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In every house flipping exercise, the first step is always to find the best deal possible. Our regression model can help us:\n",
    "   1.  confirm if the house is selling below its fair value/at a discount; \n",
    "   2.  identify attributes to modify the house for us to maximise the house prices; \n",
    "   3.  determine the fair value of the house post-renovations;\n",
    "   4.  understand which kind of house we should be targeting"

    "1. Out of all regressors, the factors that affect salesprice the most is the the size/quality factor.\n",
    "    - ie. Big and quality houses will fetch a disproportionally higher premiums than small/poor-quality houses.\n",
    "    - This also means that individually, having a big house or a good quality house itself will not bring in the premiums.\n",
    "    - Business Evaluation: This shows us that if we purchase a big house of poor quality, and renovate it such that the quality improves, this will fetch us a much higher profit from the house.\n",
    "2. Second to the size/quality factor is the quality factor of the house. \n",
    "    - Houseage, which is indicative of the quality of the house, is highly correlated to the saleprice of the house. \n",
    "    - However, it is possible to offset this negative factor by introducing more positive factors to our house, ie. renovations, material changes, quality improvements etc.\n",
    "3. Neighbourhood and Building types of houses moderately impact the saleprice of houses. \n",
    "    - Prime neighbourhoods appear to be NridgeHt, StoneBr, Crawfor and Somerst in descending order (NridgeHt is the most premium). \n",

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations to our clients are on a case-by-case basis. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to a dynamic problem like house flipping and investing exercises. However, these are some generic recommendations suitable for different kinds of clients:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For retail investors:** Buy-and-Hold strategy\n",
    "1. To invest in a house that is generally situated around the prime neighbourhoods (NridgeHt, StoneBr, Crawfor and Somerst).\n",
    "2. Ideally, purchase a bigger house and renovate towards the end of your investment to improve quality of the house. This will bring a disproportionally bigger premium in the market. This will also help with the 'years after renovation\" considerations that buyers have. \n",
    "3. A downside to the buy-and-hold strategy is that the houseprices also decrease disproportionally due to the increased age of house. To buffer the decrease in premiums, we should be mindful of the materials we choose when renovating the house near full-term.\n",
    "    - A foundation material of Poured Contrete alongside a large houses (masonry/lotarea) is highly preferred by buyers.\n",
    "    - General preference hip-styled roof than mansard-styled roof. However, renovations for rooftops often come with a heavy price tag, hence we need to weigh the trade-offs and see if it is still worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For house-flippers:** Buy-Flip-Sell strategy\n",
    "1. Location will not be a big concern for an ultra-short term investment, as location-based premiums generally rises in the long-run due to changes in demographic, amenenities etc. \n",
    "2. The same goes to \"Houseage\" as a factor in price determination, as an ultra-short term investment will not affect the 'houseage' factor which is predicted to depress prices. \n",
    "    - Contrary, renovations done within the investment holdings period will set 'years after renovations\" to be 0. This also lift prices. \n",
    "2. The key to a successful flipping strategy is to buy-low and sell-high. Hence, finding a good house at a low price is essential in this strategy.\n",
    "3. A key to success is also the size of the house. \n",
    "    - Our model suggest that houses that are big and extremely poor in quality will depress prices by a significant amount. Hence, buying them at a low price is plausible. This also suggest that the strategy of renovations will work well based on our model prediction.\n",
    "    - Preferably, find a house that has a garage and basement. These are elements of houses that lift prices. \n",
    "4. Similar to the buy-and-hold strategy, we should be really mindful in the materials chosen for our renovation work. Suggestions for desirable materials are listed above (in the buy-and-hold strategy). "

Many factors would have changed post-2010, including neighbourhood amenities changes, demographic changes, taste & preferences of consumers etc. \n",
    "    - Data showed that 2010 house sales have dipped in numbers compared to all other years. However, we do not have data for 2010-onwards.
