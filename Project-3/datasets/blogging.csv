I want to write a blog post about self care for someone with schizophrenia on my blog which is focused on schizophrenia.

Background:

I've been blogging for about 4 years and have crossed the 100 post mark... but I'm still lucky to get more than a couple of google hits a day. I must be doing something wrong. 

I really haven't done keyword research - don't know how to.

I use keywords that are usually the title of the article and then follow the Wordpress guides until the SEO is green. I make improvements until the readability is green.

My posts are generally around 7-900 words. Lately I've been trying to be higher than that more around 12-1500. I've also updated to a new premium theme to try and pretty-up the site.

I was thinking I would use ""schizophrenia self care"" ... does that seem reasonable? Am I missing an opportunity on keywords here? What would be a good workflow after selection of a keyword through publishing and then promotion?

I'm really losing my motivation here and am getting a bit desperate. My primary purpose of my blog is for my own outlet of issues... which I do get - but I would also like to know that others benefit from it as well. I'm trying to get involved to help others as a peer both locally and online.

&lt;p&gt;I really wanna do this for side income and to practice my writing skills. I found a niche I want to talk about but I&amp;#39;m worried that my goals are unrealistic which is $100-200 a month. How much views do you need to reach that goal? Also, my goal is to reach $5,000 **in total by 5 years... is that too much?&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"So I’ve had my blog active for nearly 2 months now, I’ve seen around 1.2k impressions from Google and only 17 organic clicks according to GSC. 

My on page SEO is as good as it gets and the content I produce is entirely my own, original, including detailed information and references. I’m a native English speaker with over 10 years genuine experience in the niche I have chosen. 

I have struggled with backlinks as given my content it feels wildly inappropriate to essentially cold call sites for links, I mean let’s face it, how often would you honestly answer an email asking for a back link, if you ever even open it? 

I recently delved into social with Instagram and Pinterest as I found it relatively easy to produce more quality content there and generate a following, the results have been good but it relies on me constantly directing traffic to the site. So I am beginning to think there’s an issue with my site in terms of SEO. I am aware that sites rarely take off in such a short time but I’ve been in touch with several like minded bloggers and watched their progress over the same time period, often finding their posts in the first page or two of results. 

I HAVE been doing keyword research, looking for high search volume, low competition and implementing those keywords on my posts, even then my posts never seem to appear in a position to generate views, never mind clicks.

So my question is, is it worth hiring someone to do a deep audit of my sites SEO, from start to finish, the hosting, the page speed, the link structure, how I’ve been submitting to GSC etc? Or is it even possible? 

I should make it clear, I’ve done hours of reading about on and off site SEO to try and find fault with the site, even if there is none, I see no harm in learning how it all fits together but I just haven’t found anything to make drastic improvement. 

I will also admit I find it very difficult to follow advice from the likes of income school etc. Whilst I have consumed a lot of this type of content and sure, some of it has been beneficial, it’s very hard to see past their own agenda, I’ve been part of discussion groups on blogging and watched as these users develop an almost cult like attitude towards these outlets and end up spending a fortune on these “gurus”.

So I am on the market for purchasing my first wordpress theme for a blog of mine I have created and when I say blog its more along the lines of a site that coincides with a youtube channel of mine where i help people out with different Mac Hacks and Cracks that I Help People out with on youtube.  


However, due to the content of some of these videos I can no longer post them on youtube without them being taken down and everyone keeps asking me to repost them again..  


So what i wanted to do was to create a nice little website where i can post some of these things and make some tutorials where i can repost some of these things as well as create a nice little home base where i can post links to my other things and posts as well  


I also have plans and the domains bought for a few other I guess you would call it Niche style blog site Ideas I have and want to create as well but whenever i go online in order to build any of these things and start researching things like themes for word press and what not I feel like i am just getting bombarded with the same couple themes repeated and thrown at me each and every way lol..

All i ever see is either Generate Press This, Astra Theme That, OceanWP, Divi, Schema, Genesis, Blahhh   


Leaving me to believe no one really cares about what i buy and they all just want me to click on their affiliate link!  


Thats why i wanted to reach out to you all on here and get your vibe on what the best themes are right now in 2020 and what themes you use or how you go about posting and keeping all of your blog sites current, eye catching, optimized, and up to date?

,Blogging,"I would like to start a financial blog focusing on wealth building, passive income and financial independence for those millennials who want to quit the 9-to-5 grind. Topics would include stock market, real estate, personal finance and passive income source creation.

I am originally Hungarian, but I am living and working in Western Europe for already 6 years. I have studied Finance (MSc degree) and I work in the financial industry. I am deeply interested in the topic of finance, this why I want to start a financial blog.

I am wondering whether I should write the blog in my native language (Hungarian) or in English. My long-term goal is to build a business around it (write ebooks, do online courses, do online coaching etc.). 

**English:** While the market in English is much much bigger (in terms of potential readers), there are a lot of very good financial blogs of all types out there.  Even though I studied MSc Finance and I work in the industry, I am 25 so my experience is limited. It's not like most big financial bloggers who share their experience. Despite this, I could still do it in a 'write-as-I-learn style', but don't know if that's unique enough. One thing I could do is focus purely on Europe or Eastern Europe (although I don't what could be general enough for all EE countries; it's rather country specific).

**Hungarian:** On the other hand, there are not THAT many BIG financial blogs in Hungary. I believe I could write about topics that I learn myself about and still be valuable for readers as most Hungarians do not speak English. What holds me back, however, is that the audience is quite limited. There are c. 9m people speaking Hungarian and according to Facebook my target audience consist of 1.9m people between the age of 18-40. In the Hungarian market, there are 3 big financial blogs and a couple of other mid/smaller ones.

I do not want to do the blog in two languages, as that would be too much work for me (I know myself).

In the Hungarian market, there are 3 big financial blogs and a couple of other mid/smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not want to do the blog in two languages, as that would be too much work for me (I know myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you please share your opinion if I should do it in English or Hungarian, and why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks friends!&lt;/p&gt;

**Monthly Summary**

So, I had my first real income this month! I signed up to Ezoic around about the middle of the month, and then almost a week later I had a huge surge of traffic from Facebook.

I have a post about a specific brand, which I think must have been shared within a big Facebook group or something. Weeks later I am still getting some traffic from Facebook on this, but on the day I got almost 6,000 visitors in a single day.

This traffic has obviously significantly reduced as we've approached the end of the month, and I suspect this month will end up seeming high compared to upcoming months for a while due to that Facebook share.

Does anyone know how I can find out who shared the post? or where it was shared in FB?

Anyway, Ezoic income for the month was just over $100 - Nothing spectacular, but it is good to see progress!

**New Hosting**

I also decided to change host this week to SiteGround. I had previously been using a super cheap host (TSOHost) which was about $4 a month, and the service was terrible. My website went down 3 times this month due to some sort of issue with their PHP, and I just lost my temper eventually, and decided that the Ezoic income should cover any hosting fees going forward, so now is the time to upgrade! So far so good - I've noticed a huge performance boost on load times. It should be interesting to see whether I get any ranking boosts because of it too.

**Niched Down**

I've sort of ""niched down"" a bit as well. I've pretty much given up on Affiliate income for the time being, and just focusing on getting as much traffic as possible and hopefully getting good ad revenue. Basically the blog's niche is too much of a 'discussion' point to really promote any products. I am effectively critiquing businesses, and it is difficult to recommend products from that. Maybe something will open up in the future, we shall see.

**Monthly Stats:** [Image Link](https://imgur.com/gallery/I8WTZMx)

As you can see, my monthly visitors have absolutely rocketed since last month. As mentioned, this is mostly due to a huge stream of Facebook traffic to one posts.

Not seen much noticeable growth of my other posts unfortunately. Just general improvement overall. I would say I'm now averaging around 200 visitors a day, if you factor out the Facebook stream.

**Goals**

* Hoping to not have too much of a dip for September, even though it is mostly expected
* Going to aim to write two content pieces per week at a minimum - Now that I see some structure in the site, it is becoming easier to write posts
* Pinterest I have now officially given up on - I'm finding the effort to reward ratio to be terrible
* Hoping to make $50 in September from Ezoic, which I think is an achievable target if I remain consistent",t2_279lxrn1,False,,0,False,Case Study - Finance Niche Blog (Month 5) - Niching Down + First REAL Income Month!,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tips/Info'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Tipsinfo,0,,False,t3_ijde8w,False,dark,0.97,,public,29,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Info,False,29,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598826026.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/gc32gq/case_study_finance_niche_blog_month_1_join_the/""&gt;Month 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"A web host is essential to blogging, especially with SEO and site speed. 

If you look up ""best web host"" on Google, you'll find tons and tons of articles recommending Bluehost-  in fact, even [Wordpress.org](https://Wordpress.org) recommends them. 

Before you sign up though, read this:

BlueHost (along with Hostgator, iPage, and 80+ other brands) are owned by hosting giant EIG ()Endurance International Group). If you haven't heard of them before, they have a large reputation in the web hosting market of gobbling up and buying out small-medium sized web hosts ""consolidating""  their infrastructure into one data center, and outsourcing and combining all their support staff. 

The result? Overloaded web servers, downtime, slow websites, and lots of support issues. You want to change hosts? Sure. Due to the sheer amount of companies they own, there a good chance you'll just move to another host they own. Gradually, many people start to assume all web hosts are the same and that the quality of EIG owned companies are the ""norm"" 

**""But XYZ Blogger/Website/Review Recommended BlueHost/HostGator as the #1 WebHost!""**

Simple. Money. Bluehost pays *at least* $65 per person you refer that signs up. These rates can go up to hundreds per referral, which quickly adds up to a lot for blogs and even companies or non-profits like [WP.org](https://WP.org) (sources say they pay WP $120-150 per signup?) that need the money. If you read them, you'll even find a lot of ""reviews"" aren't even reviews. They literally state what features a host offers and comments on their pricing. 

Write something bad about an EIG host? They'll pay you to shut up.  (Can't find the link right now, will update if I do, but there are documented cases of Bluehost reaching out to bloggers that right poor reviews and offer them extremely high affiliate rates to remove the review and promote them,)

**""I've been using BlueHost for X Years. They work fine for me""**

Not every plan is the same, and you might get a server that is less overloaded and get decent performance. But, the price to performance ratio you'll be getting will be far lower than what you get basically anywhere else. 

As a developer, I've had many clients reach out to me saying ""My WordPress website is slow! Why?"" and the first question I ask is: ""Who is your host?"" 90% of the time its BlueHost or Godaddy or Hostgator. Not saying you can't get good performance with them (perfectly possible with the proper setup), but the time you spend trying to optimize will be far far more than what it takes to use any other web host.

**""But they host over 2 million websites! Maybe you just had a bad experience?""**

There are hundreds of thousands of other people who've been disgusted by BlueHost and move away. Yet, Bluehost still gets millions of customers because of a few reasons:

1. They make you pay 3 years in advanced to get a ""special"" discounted rate
2. Most don't know any better
3. They switch to another EIG-owned WebHost and discover it's no better

I've also personally moved over a hundred people away from BlueHost, Hostgator, GoDaddy, iPage, A Small Orange, Site5, just to name a few because they weren't happy with the performance, security, or support and the difference is night and day. 

Don't believe me?

Just look at the [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.bluehost.com) reviews for BlueHost. Or on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/f22imh/why_does_wpcom_recommend_bluehost/fhafcpf/?context=3), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/9tw69b/bluehost_sucks/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/99kngu/beware_of_affiliate_bloggers_who_recommend_web/).

GoDaddy and its parent company run a similar scheme though they don't own as many companies by far. They do, however, engage in practices like charging inordinate amounts for SSL (basically everyone provides it for free), attempting to upsell service to you at every corner, and also cramming a ton of site on one server, resulting in slow websites. 

Want to start a blog? Do yourself, your visitors, and your web developer a favor and use **any** other web host besides EIG-owned ones and GoDaddy.

I am not a dietitian or a nutritionist but I worked with my uncle who is a registered dietician and I learned quite a lot of stuff from him. I personally am quite interested in the topic of human nutrition and I also struggled with weight issues myself during most of my life so far. So I started a blog where I want to share my opinions on that topic, my personal experiences, findings, insights, etc... I also have an original idea (asymptotic nutrition approach) related to nutrition, which was the main idea behind the whole website.

So when you sum it all up, the purpose of the website is double:

\- to explore this asymptotic nutrition approach to weight loss

 *(the idea is really simple:  that we should skip the restrictive phase of a diet and instead go straight to the maintenance phase, by consuming the amount of calories that we would need at our target weight, and that if we do it, our weight will asymptotically approach that target weight... why this happens and why I think it is a good idea to do it like that is explained in detail on the website)*

\- to be some sort of portal where you could find interesting and informative articles about nutrition in general, my experiences, opinions, analyses of certain diets or food items...

Also the idea is to be blunt and provocative, exposing all sorts of dietary bullshit and to stick to sound and evidence based approaches. To offer healthy criticism to certain fad diets and ideas that are being pushed around and to explore in general trends in nutrition, by critically examining them.

So my question is: do you see potential in this type of website?

Where could be the best place to promote it?

Would YouTube be helpful?

Is there a need for paid ads?

Could such a website generate some income as well? Maybe from ads on the website? Maybe via instagram? Any ideas... ?

I have a, probably stupid, question about ranking. But I'm still asking it because I'm genuinely curious and I know there are experienced bloggers on here.

My website is currently just under 1.5 months old. When I look at my Google Search Console I see my website is getting more and more impressions (no clicks, but impressions), especially in the past week or so. But all of my articles bar 1 are ranking at position 50-120 (anywhere in between), as mentioned 1 article doesn't and actually ranks at position 10 according to GSC (actually position 6 when I google the term myself).

My question is: Will these articles rank higher when I'm out of the 'sandbox' as my site ages and I produce more and more content? Or will they always stay at these high positions meaning nobody will ever click through to my site? 

Disclaimer: I am very aware that it will take a lot of time to actually grow organically. I'm prepared to keep writing content for a long time as it's in a niche I really like anyway. But I genuinely wonder if my rankings will get better if I just have patience. My current amount of impressions is 476 and the amount of clicks is 3, CTR 0.6%.

,Blogging,"As a total beginner in the field of blogging, I have some questions with regard to image optimization for a WordPress blog. More specifically, questions about image dimensions for a blog post and the optimization workflow for these images.

Currently, I am using GIMP (with a 'save for web' plugin) to crop and optimize the size of the image files, before uploading them to WordPress.

One of the things I noticed immediately was the fact that the dimensions of my images were not exactly similar, which doesn't benefit the uniformity of the blog. Hence my first question: are there preferred image dimensions (or maybe ratios?) for a blog post, and how important is image uniformity?

The second question concerning dimensions involves the thumbnail for the blog post. If you optimize an image as the featured image for a blog post, is it best practice to optimize the same image separately as thumbnail? Or does that harm SEO (in terms of duplicate content)?

Since I currently only use GIMP, I wondered if there were more convenient workflows for image optimization and/or tips/tricks/programs/plugins that are useful to speed up the process?

I'm really struggling to get visitor to my new blog. It is a blog where I write about life tips for young adults (surviving your 20's) and I'm focusing on solving a specific problem through my articles, like saving money, finding work, feeling lonely etc.

I've been using Pinterest and created ""attractive"" Pins with call to action and bold headlines. I rarely get a visit and if I do, the visitor doesn't stay on my blog, according to my analytics.

On the other hand, I had a fashion blog where I had a lot of product images, which I shared on Pinterest. I still get traffic to my fashion blog even it's not active anymore (around 1000 visits per month. 

I didn't really have a Pinterest strategy for my fashion blog. I would just share the product images to Pinterest and it got me a lot of traffic.

My question to you: do you have a text based blog and get good traffic from Pinterest?

This past year (and even within the past couple of months), I’ve seen a huge improvement with my blog’s views. 

This time last year I was only getting 200-300 views a month and just few months ago I was able to reach 1k views, which then grew to 1.5k, and now I’m sitting at a little over 2k views a month (which I know still isn’t a lot haha).

I hope to keep the momentum going but I’m not sure where to go next?

Two major changes I made were posting more consistently (it’s still not perfect), creating a Pinterest marketing routine, and improving my SEO skills.

Some ideas on what I could do next:

Besides learning new blogging skills, I’ve considered joining Tailwind or purchasing a Pinterest course. I would love to know your thoughts on Tailwind and on blogging courses. Are they worth it?

,Blogging,"My Question - Why don't Google just show relevant results in a single scroll. This will definitely boost traffic for sites standing in the 2nd page Google SERPs at least. Why they are not doing this? 

Anyway here are Brian's key findings. 

1. Google searchers use one of Google’s autocompleting suggestions 23% of the time. People that search for informational and local searches tended to click on an autocomplete suggestion more often than those searching with commercial queries.

2. 50% of Google users click on their results within 9 seconds of searching. And the average amount of time it takes a Google searcher to click on something is 14.6 seconds.

3. Only 9% of Google searchers make it to the bottom of the first page of the search results.

4. 15% of users modify their initial search terms. This suggests that Google tends to serve up highly-relevant results. Or that Google users are adept at choosing the right keyword on their first attempt.

5. Only 17% of users bounced back to the search results after clicking on a result. Only 5% of users bounce more than once for the same query.

6. The majority (59%) of Google users visit a single page during their search session. Only 6% need to visit four or more pages in order to get an answer to their query.

7. 65% of searchers click on a traditional “10 blue link” search result during their search session.

8. Although this varied widely depending on the query, 19% of searchers click on a Google Ad during their search.

9. For local queries, 42% of searchers click on results inside of the Google Maps Pack.

10. 19% of users searching for a product click on a Google Shopping result.

11. On average, only 3% of searchers interact with a “People Also Ask” box. Although this behavior varies widely depending on the query. For example, 13.6% of people searching for supplements clicked on a PAA box.

12. Only .44% of searchers go to the second page of Google’s search results.

13. The average search session takes 76 seconds to complete. And half of all search sessions are finished within 53 seconds.

&lt;p&gt;3. Only 9% of Google searchers make it to the bottom of the first page of the search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. 15% of users modify their initial search terms. This suggests that Google tends to serve up highly-relevant results. Or that Google users are adept at choosing the right keyword on their first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only 17% of users bounced back to the search results after clicking on a result. Only 5% of users bounce more than once for the same query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. The majority (59%) of Google users visit a single page during their search session. Only 6% need to visit four or more pages in order to get an answer to their query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. 65% of searchers click on a traditional “10 blue link” search result during their search session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this varied widely depending on the query, 19% of searchers click on a Google Ad during their search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For local queries, 42% of searchers click on results inside of the Google Maps Pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10. 19% of users searching for a product click on a Google Shopping result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average, only 3% of searchers interact with a “People Also Ask” box. Although this behavior varies widely depending on the query. For example, 13.6% of people searching for supplements clicked on a PAA box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12. Only .44% of searchers go to the second page of Google’s search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13. The average search session takes 76 seconds to complete. And half of all search sessions are finished within 53 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

1) Suppose it's an article related to a prominent person or celebrity, I would message all their fan pages requesting them to share my article. I've had some luck so far getting 20-30 odd views from them


2) Viral videos that originated from Twitter have a lot of potential. I've done articles on a user's viral video and all they did is retweet it, and when curious twitter users click on their profile they see my article link and would read it. I got about 2,900 views on one such article

The Optimist Sees Opportunity In Every Difficulty.” It is time to take advantage of every opportunity even when you are clutter with distraction in all angle. In a world of constant distraction, here are 5 quick motivational hacks you can perform to motivate yourself without stress.

**Eliminate Distraction**

According to a recent study by [Kaspersky](http://technology.inquirer.net/51653/kaspersky-lab-study-proves-smartphones-lead-to-lower-productivity/), if you have a smartphone beside you while working, it reduces your productivity by 26% because you will be tempted to check what is trending. To boost your productivity, you can turn off your notifications or put your phone on a focus mode. However, there are software and apps that can help block distraction while working.

I’m planning to switch to a different hosting. I don’t know if I can considering the crappy service I’m getting from my hosting provider. 

so I’ve been blogging for almost 3 months now. I've no problem with my hosting before.

Unfortunately, my shitty hosting provider did an update and according to the support; 

“our SysAdmin accidentally formatted the SSD disks (3TB Files) during Maintenance, and it's being restored now”

I also got an email saying “**if you have a backup of your website please re-upload it**

**We accidentally formatted the SSD Drives -  rest assured that we are doing our best to restore the deleted web files and emails**

**Affected Disks 7,9,4,5 - 984 Websites Hosted**

**Gravity Server (cPanel Shared Web Host Server)**

and it’s been a week and there’s no progress at all. I can’t even access my WordPress admin page. I keep getting 

**“Not Found**

The requested URL was not found on this server.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.”

,Blogging,"*I know its the backend of August but I am really busy with off-line stuff this month so haven't had the time to get the report online for July until now.*

I am switching up the format for these posts slightly and only focusing on what I have actually done to grow the network each month rather than go over the older sites in the network that haven't been touched for the reporting month. This is the third update in this series of tracking my progress to growing a blog network to over $25,000 a month and you can find the earlier entries below:-

* [One - May 2020.](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/gyauo1/growing_a_blog_network_to_25000_a_month_may_2020/)
* [Two - June 2020.](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/hms7f1/growing_a_blog_network_to_25000_a_month_june_2020/)

The income breakdown for the full blog network (7 domains, 3 over a year old, 2 making most of the income) is around $5599 for the month of July with the dashboard screenshots for the various affiliate and ad networks below.

* [Amazon One Link - $5471.73](https://i.imgur.com/5mV8AgI.png)
* [Adsense - $62.65](https://i.imgur.com/33dUeBd.png)
* [Amazon Australia - AUD 74.40 Around $50](https://i.imgur.com/dCm6cv6.png)
* [eBay - $26](https://i.imgur.com/o0LWnJy.png)

Again, the vast majority of my income for July comes from the Amazon affiliate program leaving me overexposed to further commission cuts from them similar to their cuts in April 2020 and 2017. This is by design though as most of my blogs are based around the Amazon Affiliate program with very few pages having Adsense or eBay on them right now.

Most of my work for the month of July was based around getting tests online to try see how they react after the May 2020 update to Googles core algorithm but my main goal moving forward is to diversify income sources as much as possible. I plan to do this in a number of ways by adding additional affiliate and referal networks as well as a premium display ad network if possible.

I churned a bunch of articles out myself for the blog I made in July but also had a few freelance writers help me and it currently has 217,093 words of content on it spread over 90 articles broken into batches of 30 for different tests. My highest income domain dropped about 20% of its traffic in the May 2020 Google core algorithm update so this domains main job is primarily testing to move forward and avoid that happening again.

# Zero Search Volume Keywords

The first test is to try out more zero search volume keywords as I have been playing with them on different domains since 2018 in small numbers and they are pulling around 50 hits per month on average. Although 50 hits per month doesn't sound like much, my buyer intent keywords run at &gt;$80-$100 per 1000 hits depending on the niche of the domain so 20 of these articles ranking brining 50 hits per month can potentially make me &gt;$80-$100 per month once ranked and getting traffic.

Although I already have a bunch of these keywords online for older domains, this batch of 30 test articles that I published in July are based around testing how deep in Google auto-suggest you can go and still get traffic to the page. Although traffic can come from long tail and secondary keywords, I wanted to test it for future blogs. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/hsrqdg/zero_search_volume_keywords_what_am_i_not_getting/) on Reddit from a few weeks ago has a bunch of opinions from other bloggers using this method to make money for their blogs too and is worth checking out if you are thinking of trying it.

# Beating The High Domain Strength Entries

The May 2020 update from Google seems to have given Amazon, Quora, Reddit, and Pinterest a boost in the search engine results page while also injecting the YouTube carousel widget into the first page of Google for tons of buyer intent keywords. Although some of the pages on my highest income blog have recovered since the update, many of them that used to be position 1 are now lower in the SERP. Although the domain lost 20% of its traffic domain wide, the specific pages that were actually hit by the update have dropped almost 50% of their traffic so I want to try work out how to get it back.

I could drop cash on some backlinks but I have seen a few blogs with very low domain strength that are still ranking in first beating the YouTube carousel and it looks like its something to do with topical relevancy. The annoying thing is that in my niche that was hit, the YouTube videos showing in some of the YouTube carousel widgets are only niche relevant and not keyword-relevant so don't actually help the person making the search query.

This test batch has some articles emphasizing topical relevancy for the target keyword when the target keyword has the YouTube carousel widget in first place to see if I can beat it. The rest of this test batch is based around keywords that don't currently have the YouTube carousel widget high on the first page of Google but do have other page types boosted by the May 2020 update such as Amazon reviews, Quora, and Reddit high on page one for the keyword to try work out ways to beat them moving forward.

# Backlinks And Internal Linking

This next test batch has all of its articles published but the backlinking side of it is on hold for now as I am not planning to backlink my next domain for the foreseeable future and I needed the cash that was for the backlinks for content for my new domain. This test batch was planned to try minimize the costs for backlink spend to rank pages in Google that are medium to high competition in the future As I want to try stick to content scaling for low competition keywords until 2021 I probably won't order the backlinks for this test batch until next year or I may just scrap it depending on how this new domain goes.

# Banking Content

The last week of July was spend typing up about 35,000 words of content to bank it for the new domain that I started on the 1st August. Although this domains job was initially just to keep me busy until December-March when the content for the test domain I build in July should age in, I am considering scaling it to be as large as possible. This is mainly due to the case study in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/ia46ai/900day_from_affiliate_100day_with_adthrive_bad/) from a few days back where the blog is making around $1000 per day. If I put a few years into scaling this new website from August and then sell it I could potentially do the whole financial independence retired early thing.

With this domain, I will be looking to diversify traffic by integrating Pinterest while also diversifying income with other affiliate programs, a premium ad network, and referral programs. This should be able to help increase the monthly income multiple valuation for the site in the future if I do choose to sell it.",t2_ygjlv,False,,0,False,"Growing A Blog Network To &gt;$25,000 A Month! - July 2020 - $5599/$25,000.","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tips/Info'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Tipsinfo,0,,False,t3_id91c0,False,dark,0.95,,public,40,0,{},2c8899b2-4b29-11e8-894b-0ea72814b416,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Info,False,40,,False,,False,flair,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'https://www.youtube.com/ShaunMarrs'}]",{},,True,,1597954034.0,richtext,6,,,richtext,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know its the backend of August but I am really busy with off-line stuff this month so haven&amp;#39;t had the time to get the report online for July until now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The annoying thing is that in my niche that was hit, the YouTube videos showing in some of the YouTube carousel widgets are only niche relevant and not keyword-relevant so don&amp;#39;t actually help the person making the search query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This test batch has some articles emphasizing topical relevancy for the target keyword when the target keyword has the YouTube carousel widget in first place to see if I can beat it. The rest of this test batch is based around keywords that don&amp;#39;t currently have the YouTube carousel widget high on the first page of Google but do have other page types boosted by the May 2020 update such as Amazon reviews, Quora, and Reddit high on page one for the keyword to try work out ways to beat them moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Backlinks And Internal Linking&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next test batch has all of its articles published but the backlinking side of it is on hold for now as I am not planning to backlink my next domain for the foreseeable future and I needed the cash that was for the backlinks for content for my new domain. This test batch was planned to try minimize the costs for backlink spend to rank pages in Google that are medium to high competition in the future As I want to try stick to content scaling for low competition keywords until 2021 I probably won&amp;#39;t order the backlinks for this test batch until next year or I may just scrap it depending on how this new domain goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Banking Content&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last week of July was spend typing up about 35,000 words of content to bank it for the new domain that I started on the 1st August. Although this domains job was initially just to keep me busy until December-March when the content for the test domain I build in July should age in, I am considering scaling it to be as large as possible. This is mainly due to the case study in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/ia46ai/900day_from_affiliate_100day_with_adthrive_bad/""&gt;this Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; from a few days back where the blog is making around $1000 per day. If I put a few years into scaling this new website from August and then sell it I could potentially do the whole financial independence retired early thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this domain, I will be looking to diversify traffic by integrating Pinterest while also diversifying income with other affiliate programs, a premium ad network, and referral programs. This should be able to help increase the monthly income multiple valuation for the site in the future if I do choose to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"Hello there!

I've been working on a website for two weeks on Wix so far I've been quite satisfied with the results. Then I read a post about why WordPress is better than Wix.

A year ago I created a website on WordPress but it was very simplistic and I didn't like it at all. I could create what I was aiming for on Wix, but I hear a lot of people say that there's more personalization with WordPress. I don't understand how. I used both platforms and clearly Wix provided the required tools to develop the website I always wanted.

I'm no web design expert and maybe I didn't know how to use WordPress' features to its fullest. If I could, I would love to get into web designing but it will take quite some time for me to learn it and I prefer to create content than to spend too much time building a site from zero. Could you all please show me the reasons WordPress is more customizable than Wix?

Also at the moment I don't have enough budget to have my own domain nor to pay hosting. So if you could help me with that, I'd very grateful.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been working on a website for two weeks on Wix so far I&amp;#39;ve been quite satisfied with the results. Then I read a post about why WordPress is better than Wix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago I created a website on WordPress but it was very simplistic and I didn&amp;#39;t like it at all. I could create what I was aiming for on Wix, but I hear a lot of people say that there&amp;#39;s more personalization with WordPress. I don&amp;#39;t understand how. I used both platforms and clearly Wix provided the required tools to develop the website I always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m no web design expert and maybe I didn&amp;#39;t know how to use WordPress&amp;#39; features to its fullest. If I could, I would love to get into web designing but it will take quite some time for me to learn it and I prefer to create content than to spend too much time building a site from zero. Could you all please show me the reasons WordPress is more customizable than Wix?&lt;/p&gt;

Right now I have a personal blog in russian which has around 1000 visitors per day. I almost never put any pictures, my posts are rather short and I don't pay attention to SEO. Nobody really knows who I am as I write a lot about gossips and stories of others without names etc. (people love stories!!!) Well, I don't really want to reveal the secret of who I am. Is it so bad for SEO?

Anyhow, currently I cannot monetize my blog, it is technically not possible, as it is on the platform livejournal. So I am thinking to switch to WordPress. I guess, I should write a topic-blog (OK, let's take ""relations"" as a topic). And I need to write it in English in order to get more visitors. I've tried to write something in English, but the text seems to be not as good as in Russian. Well, I don't know as many words and proverbs in English as in Russian.

Is there anybody writing blog in English who is not a native spreaker? I guess, if you are not a native speaker, it is not possible to write always without any mistakes. How do you edit your texts?

,Blogging,"Hello everyone,

Here is the month 2 update for my case study, if you haven’t read part 1 then [you can check it out here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/hvpred/updating_content_case_study_month_1/).

I have got off to a pretty good start and managed to complete the initial audit of working through my low performing/0 traffic articles, and sorting the articles into update/re-write, 301/combine, and delete tabs.

I will be handling my top 100 traffic articles separately, the initial focus is on articles that are currently generating 0 or very low amounts of traffic, which is a fair amount unfortunately.

The initial audit was quite a time-consuming process as I did a quick manual review on the articles individually to determine if;

* it’s worthwhile updating.
* I should have targeted a different/better keyword.
* I should combine it with another article and 301.
* If the article should just be deleted (last resort).

With the underperforming articles (0 or minimal traffic), I am basically trying to do in such a way where I am asking myself ‘would I target this keyword today?’.

If the answer is no, then I try to look for alternative keywords that make more sense (better search volume and lower competition).

The general process I have been following is;

1. Google my target keyword.
2. What’s the search volume for the keyword? (just for reference though I take this with a pinch of salt as estimated search volume is often very wrong with most tools, especially when dealing with long tail keywords).
3. Are my competitors targeting the same keyword (h1/title)?
4. Is there a better and less competitive term I should have targeted? (if so, make a note of it and re-target that keyword in my title/h1 if it’s closely relevant, or do a 301 a new article if it’s not).
5. What's the competition like? Is it worth spending time trying to update this, aka can I actually rank for this keyword?
6. Where am I currently ranking for this keyword?
7. How does my article stand up against the current top 3.
8. Any duplication with current articles, if so make a note so I can combine/301?

That’s pretty much it, based on the above I then assigned it a tab and if it’s going in re-write/update I will add some comments and give it my own competition rating out of 10.

I know I probably made a few mistakes, but I have really developed the mindset of as-long as I can get it right 80% of the time then that’s ok. Trying to be a perfectionist is time consuming and doesn’t help with productivity.

To add some additional comments;

* I have left off any article that I was given a competition rating of 6/10 or higher, I can potentially revisit that later but for now, I want to focus on the ones that I should have a good chance of improving and actually ranking for.
* A lot of these articles have been neglected for a long time, some not updated since 2016 (ouch).
* Some of the articles are thin and just plain poor content, particularly the early ones (when I still learning).. I did question myself when looking at some of them ‘was I drunk?’ Lol, but I guess it’s a good reminder of how far I have come over the years.
* There are a few low search keywords where I am ranking on page 1 but not in the top 3, I have left these on the majority are quite high ticket products and feel it will be beneficial to try and push them into top spots of page 1.
* I found quite a few articles where there is some duplication, I have noted these so I can combine them and do a 301. An example is say one article targeting ‘best football boots’ and another targeting ‘best football boots for ‘x’ (not my niche, just an example).

I have a number of these articles and sometimes it works ok, but other times it doesn’t. I have just been going by the Google results as to whether they should be combined or not.

For some keywords it makes sense for them to be separate where it’s a very specific topic area and Google reflects that in the results.

# Things I have noticed when doing this audit;

Since the May updates, I have found it a bit harder doing accurate competition analysis as signs of weak competition before, do not necessarily mean the same thing now.

Here are some of my observations;

1. Quora is ranking a lot more, it’s definitely been given more weight by Google.
2. Pintrest is ranking a lot, I have checked many of the pins and a high % of them are poor quality, old and thin articles.. confusing and makes no sense to me how these are ranking well.
3. High authority niche specific domains targeting keywords a world outside of there niche area, and ranking :( I am not just talking about the usual suspects here. Imagine a really high authority niche website that’s highly focused on say the sewing niche, that decided to start doing affiliate articles for the fishing gear niche or something completely random to its core subject.. neither of them are my nice area but just to give an example. I’m surprised Google is rewarding these sites that are essentially just taking advantage of the high domain authority.
4. Youtube ranking on page 1 is now extremely common, while I believe it makes sense for many ‘how to’ related terms, there are a lot of terms Youtube is ranking for (and in some cases for multiple SERPS) that really do not make any sense or actually serve the users query.
5. Amazon ranking on page 1, in some cases for position 1, 2 and 3 (for product pages, and review pages). Google has definitely given more weight and love to Amazon.
6. There is a lot more competition in my niche, that in many cases, has better, more in-depth content than me (currently).

&amp;#x200B;

# I have made a start updating articles

I did give a brief summary of my process for updating articles but just to expand on that a bit.

I know a lot of people will recommend focusing first on high traffic articles first, but I have decided to do the opposite for 2 reasons;

1. I can see what’s working, I have not used Surfer SEO before or this specific strategy. So by first doing my low or 0 articles, I can experiment a bit and actually see what makes the difference, or if I need to adjust my strategy.
2. I feel there are some potential easy wins to be had after doing the audit on my current 0 traffic articles, many of these have targeted good keywords but the content is poor, and many are sitting on page 2-3.

&amp;#x200B;

# Here is a brief of the process;

**Stage 1: Google Search Console**

1. Pull the data from Google search console for the article.
2. Export to Google Sheets (I am doing everything in my google drive so it’s all in one place).
3. Filter the data to show the highest impression terms at the top, and lowest at the bottom.
4. Add a filter to show if my current article includes the keywords already (this involves using a filter, and pasting my article in a separate tab).
5. Try to identify missing terms that should potentially be targeted/included in my article.
6. Make sure I am targetting the right keyword (i.e. high or highest impression term from search console data).

**Stage 2: Surfer SEO**

1. Run the keyword and my URL through Surfer SERP Analyzer vs top 3 or 4 competitors.
2. Try to fix suggested issues as per Surfer recommendations (within reason).
   1. Word count.
   2. Adding/removing phrases.
   3. Adding Images.
   4. Adding/removing headers or paragraphs.
   5. etc

**Stage 3: Compare competitor articles to mine**

I have been doing this in parallel with stage 2, I usually open the competitor top 3/4 articles in separate tabs so I can cross-check and do a comparison;

1. Is my title as good? does it need to be changed?
2. How does my article compare, am I missing out any obvious topics that I need to add (if I need to increase word count)?
3. If the article is really poor, thin and just a bad old article then I have been doing a complete re-write using the Surfer content editor.

**Stage 4: Google Related Searches / Answer the Public**

1. Any missing related subtopics I can include?
2. Can I add a Q&amp;A at the bottom of the article to capture more long tails?

**Stage 5: Get on with it…**

1. Make adjustments needed as per stages 1-4.
2. Try to optimise better for featured snippet.
3. Improve readability (break up paragraphs, add more sub-headers if needed).
4. Add more images (if needed), work in some missing keywords as img alt tags.
5. Review internal link, add more (to and from this article and others).
6. Update the article, set as today’s date.
7. Add main keyword and related terms in SERP Robot so I can track ranking changes.
8. Resubmit in Google Search Console (request reindexing).
9. Rinse, repeat and track.

For each exported article file from Search Console I have been adding the below checklist onto the file;

* **Date Changes Made:**
* **Word count added or removed:**
* **New Internal Links In This Article:**
* **New Internal Links Pointing To This Article:**
* **Article title changed?**
* **Meta changed?**
* **Lead paragraph changed?**
* **Affiliate Links or Removed?**
* **Broken up paragraphs?**
* **Checked spelling/grammar?**
* **Added images or videos?**
* **image 1 alt tag**
* **image 2 alt tag**
* **image 3 alt tag**
* **image 4 alt tag**
* **Completed Surfer Audit?**
* **Other comments:**

Once I complete each update I complete the checklist, and move the file to my 'completed updates' file in my Google drive, mark off as complete on my \[all articles file\], then move on.

Doing the updates has certainly been more time consuming than I expected it to be, I am trying not to rush through so they are done to a good standard (without trying to be a perfectionist).

# Results so far...

So far I have managed to update 25 articles and re-written 8 articles using the Surfer content editor.

I have been adding the main keyword, and some secondary keywords into SERP Robot so I can track the progress to see what is working.

I have noticed that the rankings have been jumping around a lot after doing the updates but for the most part, they are improving.

For the most part, the updates do seem to be having a positive impact, I must admit I did expect to see some much higher ranking changes but given they are all recent (some still within a few days) perhaps some will continue to move up over the coming days/weeks.

I plan to keep working through the lower/0 traffic articles and monitoring the changes, once I am confident enough in the process I will shift onto my high traffic articles to hopefully push them up further and really reap the results.

My traffic has not changed much, I did get excited last week when the Google blip happened, I went up to 3k visitors for one day but then back to normal. Google later confirmed it was an error that has been fixed,  fun times!

One thing I have noticed is my site speed needs to be improved, I constantly get errors on Surfer that my site is a lot slower than competitors and think I have pinned the problem so planning to improve that soon, which hopefully will help me.",t2_1pzxh46e,False,,0,False,Updating Content: Case Study [Month 2],"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tips/Info'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Tipsinfo,0,,False,t3_ic4drj,False,dark,0.67,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Info,False,3,,False,,1597772071.0,,[],{},,True,,1597797194.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;it’s worthwhile updating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should have targeted a different/better keyword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should combine it with another article and 301.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the article should just be deleted (last resort).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the underperforming articles (0 or minimal traffic), I am basically trying to do in such a way where I am asking myself ‘would I target this keyword today?’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answer is no, then I try to look for alternative keywords that make more sense (better search volume and lower competition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general process I have been following is;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google my target keyword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the search volume for the keyword? (just for reference though I take this with a pinch of salt as estimated search volume is often very wrong with most tools, especially when dealing with long tail keywords).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are my competitors targeting the same keyword (h1/title)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a better and less competitive term I should have targeted? (if so, make a note of it and re-target that keyword in my title/h1 if it’s closely relevant, or do a 301 a new article if it’s not).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;#39;s the competition like? Is it worth spending time trying to update this, aka can I actually rank for this keyword?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where am I currently ranking for this keyword?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does my article stand up against the current top 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any duplication with current articles, if so make a note so I can combine/301?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much it, based on the above I then assigned it a tab and if it’s going in re-write/update I will add some comments and give it my own competition rating out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I probably made a few mistakes, but I have really developed the mindset of as-long as I can get it right 80% of the time then that’s ok. Trying to be a perfectionist is time consuming and doesn’t help with productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add some additional comments;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have left off any article that I was given a competition rating of 6/10 or higher, I can potentially revisit that later but for now, I want to focus on the ones that I should have a good chance of improving and actually ranking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of these articles have been neglected for a long time, some not updated since 2016 (ouch).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the articles are thin and just plain poor content, particularly the early ones (when I still learning).. I did question myself when looking at some of them ‘was I drunk?’ Lol, but I guess it’s a good reminder of how far I have come over the years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a few low search keywords where I am ranking on page 1 but not in the top 3, I have left these on the majority are quite high ticket products and feel it will be beneficial to try and push them into top spots of page 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found quite a few articles where there is some duplication, I have noted these so I can combine them and do a 301. An example is say one article targeting ‘best football boots’ and another targeting ‘best football boots for ‘x’ (not my niche, just an example).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a number of these articles and sometimes it works ok, but other times it doesn’t. I have just been going by the Google results as to whether they should be combined or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some keywords it makes sense for them to be separate where it’s a very specific topic area and Google reflects that in the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Things I have noticed when doing this audit;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the May updates, I have found it a bit harder doing accurate competition analysis as signs of weak competition before, do not necessarily mean the same thing now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my observations;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quora is ranking a lot more, it’s definitely been given more weight by Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pintrest is ranking a lot, I have checked many of the pins and a high % of them are poor quality, old and thin articles.. confusing and makes no sense to me how these are ranking well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High authority niche specific domains targeting keywords a world outside of there niche area, and ranking :( I am not just talking about the usual suspects here. Imagine a really high authority niche website that’s highly focused on say the sewing niche, that decided to start doing affiliate articles for the fishing gear niche or something completely random to its core subject.. neither of them are my nice area but just to give an example. I’m surprised Google is rewarding these sites that are essentially just taking advantage of the high domain authority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Youtube ranking on page 1 is now extremely common, while I believe it makes sense for many ‘how to’ related terms, there are a lot of terms Youtube is ranking for (and in some cases for multiple SERPS) that really do not make any sense or actually serve the users query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon ranking on page 1, in some cases for position 1, 2 and 3 (for product pages, and review pages). Google has definitely given more weight and love to Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot more competition in my niche, that in many cases, has better, more in-depth content than me (currently).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;I have made a start updating articles&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did give a brief summary of my process for updating articles but just to expand on that a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people will recommend focusing first on high traffic articles first, but I have decided to do the opposite for 2 reasons;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can see what’s working, I have not used Surfer SEO before or this specific strategy. So by first doing my low or 0 articles, I can experiment a bit and actually see what makes the difference, or if I need to adjust my strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel there are some potential easy wins to be had after doing the audit on my current 0 traffic articles, many of these have targeted good keywords but the content is poor, and many are sitting on page 2-3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Here is a brief of the process;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1: Google Search Console&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull the data from Google search console for the article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export to Google Sheets (I am doing everything in my google drive so it’s all in one place).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter the data to show the highest impression terms at the top, and lowest at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a filter to show if my current article includes the keywords already (this involves using a filter, and pasting my article in a separate tab).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to identify missing terms that should potentially be targeted/included in my article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure I am targetting the right keyword (i.e. high or highest impression term from search console data).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2: Surfer SEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the keyword and my URL through Surfer SERP Analyzer vs top 3 or 4 competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to fix suggested issues as per Surfer recommendations (within reason).

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Word count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding/removing phrases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding Images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding/removing headers or paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3: Compare competitor articles to mine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been doing this in parallel with stage 2, I usually open the competitor top 3/4 articles in separate tabs so I can cross-check and do a comparison;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my title as good? does it need to be changed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does my article compare, am I missing out any obvious topics that I need to add (if I need to increase word count)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the article is really poor, thin and just a bad old article then I have been doing a complete re-write using the Surfer content editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4: Google Related Searches / Answer the Public&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any missing related subtopics I can include?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I add a Q&amp;amp;A at the bottom of the article to capture more long tails?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 5: Get on with it…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make adjustments needed as per stages 1-4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to optimise better for featured snippet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve readability (break up paragraphs, add more sub-headers if needed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more images (if needed), work in some missing keywords as img alt tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review internal link, add more (to and from this article and others).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the article, set as today’s date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add main keyword and related terms in SERP Robot so I can track ranking changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resubmit in Google Search Console (request reindexing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rinse, repeat and track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each exported article file from Search Console I have been adding the below checklist onto the file;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date Changes Made:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word count added or removed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Internal Links In This Article:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Internal Links Pointing To This Article:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article title changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead paragraph changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affiliate Links or Removed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken up paragraphs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checked spelling/grammar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added images or videos?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;image 1 alt tag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;image 2 alt tag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;image 3 alt tag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;image 4 alt tag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completed Surfer Audit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other comments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I complete each update I complete the checklist, and move the file to my &amp;#39;completed updates&amp;#39; file in my Google drive, mark off as complete on my [all articles file], then move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing the updates has certainly been more time consuming than I expected it to be, I am trying not to rush through so they are done to a good standard (without trying to be a perfectionist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Results so far...&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I have managed to update 25 articles and re-written 8 articles using the Surfer content editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been adding the main keyword, and some secondary keywords into SERP Robot so I can track the progress to see what is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that the rankings have been jumping around a lot after doing the updates but for the most part, they are improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is a summary;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Latest Ranking&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Best Ranking&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;First Ranking&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;36&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the updates do seem to be having a positive impact, I must admit I did expect to see some much higher ranking changes but given they are all recent (some still within a few days) perhaps some will continue to move up over the coming days/weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to keep working through the lower/0 traffic articles and monitoring the changes, once I am confident enough in the process I will shift onto my high traffic articles to hopefully push them up further and really reap the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My traffic has not changed much, I did get excited last week when the Google blip happened, I went up to 3k visitors for one day but then back to normal. Google later confirmed it was an error that has been fixed,  fun times!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I have noticed is my site speed needs to be improved, I constantly get errors on Surfer that my site is a lot slower than competitors and think I have pinned the problem so planning to improve that soon, which hopefully will help me.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been doing a full site audit and content update case study after being hit with the Google May update (I am doing a case study on it in this sub).

I have been using Surfer which kept giving me flags for speed/load time where my site is massively higher than competitors so I did a bit of digging into, and Disqus comment plugin seems to be the main culprit for really slowing my site down. (Mobile speed is below 50% in many cases according to Google PageSpeed Insights).

I am contemplating just deleting the Disqus plugin all together to see what impact it has, I believe it will really bump my mobile speed to where it should be, and in line with my competitors.

I do not have access to the Disqus account, it was set up by the original site owner who is not reachable these days so I cannot export comments, it would be a case of just completely removing it so all the comments would be gone.

Does anyone know if there is likely to be any negative impact from just deleting the plugin all together? slightly worried about it having some negative SEO impact with all the comments disappearing.

,Blogging,"### The Food Blogger Pro Podcast

If *The Food Blogger Pro Podcast* isn't the best podcast out there for bloggers, it's certainly close. The host, Bjork Ostrom, has a knack for interviewing his guests that few other hosts in the space do. Don't be fooled by the name either – this is not *just* for food bloggers. If it's related to blogging, they've discussed it in-depth somewhere in their episode archive, of that we're sure. In our books, this is a “must download.”

### The Do You Even Blog Podcast

Not terribly unlike the podcast above, this is also an in-depth interview style podcast. The quirky host of the show, Pete McPherson, aims to allow the best bloggers, entrepreneurs and folks in online business to share all they know in one tidy episode.

### The Goal Digger Podcast

The *Goal Digger Podcast* isn't blogging specific, but it's useful for content creators at large, or bloggers who are looking to grow their brand. Objectively, Jenna Kutcher's podcast is a little more geared towards female content creators, but, in the end, it'll be useful for you regardless of what gender you personally identify with. More than other podcasts, the host really draws upon personal experience to help bloggers and content creators in their journey – a touch which has garnered here an enormous fanbase.

### How I Built This with Guy Raz

Firstly, there are few better podcast voices in the radio and podcast game than Guy Raz, so let's just get that out of the way first. This too isn't a classic “blogging podcast,” but the reason it's valuable for bloggers is because each week Guy talks with someone who has built something from scratch and highlights their trials and tribulations. As you know, success is rarely a linear journey, and that's an important lesson for us to remember as we're building our sites and brands.

### The ProBlogger Podcast

The *ProBlogger Podcast* isn't nearly as active as it used to be, but host Darren Rowse has still built up an impressive backlog of nearly 300 episodes. Suffice to say, the man has earned a break. Simply put, the show aims to help bloggers make that step towards making money with their blogs. 

### Simple Pin Podcast

Kate Ahl knows her stuff when it comes to Pinterest, that's for sure. You wouldn't think there would be over 200 episodes of content to talk about if you were only focused on just Pinterest, but you'd be wrong. 

### The Science of Social Media

This podcast is at it sounds, and the reason it may be appealing to some bloggers is because the episodes are short and quick-hitting. In fact, episodes are rarely over 15 minutes in length. If you're an intermediate or advanced blogger or content creator, you won't need to listen to all episodes of *The Science of Social Media*, but some episodes of this podcast, produced by Buffer, will hit the mark. It's a worthwhile podcast for bloggers to, at the very least, subscribe to and keep an eye on.

### The Knowledge Project

Of all the podcasts listed here, you could argue that *The Knowledge Project* is the furthest from pure “blogging,” but, ultimately, we're listing podcasts we feel will help bloggers grow, and that's exactly what this podcast will accomplish. Host Shane Parrish aims to “help you master the best of what other people have already figured out.” It's more about mental models and looking at thinking on a macro level, but plenty of these episodes will connect with you if you've got that entrepreneurial spirit inside you which, considering you're here, we're guessing you do.

### The Blogging Millionaire

*The Blogging Millionaire* podcast is all about very short snippets of audio which deal with a specific aspect of blogging. Sometimes, it's going to be a topic that you already know, and simply don't need to listen to, but some episodes can be helpful. At the very least, it's a reminder on your podcast feed of what you should know to be a successful blogger nowadays.

### The Side Hustle Show

Back in the day, you could afford to simply be a “blogger,” but now more than ever you need to be a brand. You need to be an effective marketer, strategist, and an outside-the-box thinker, and that's where listening to *The Side Hustle Show* helps. Host Nick Loper chats with folks who are making an extra buck here and there in inventive ways. If you're just starting your blog, this is a podcast that can help you think of ways to supplement your income before you've monetized your blog.

For historical reasons, I still manage my blog subscriptions via FeedBurner. The number of subscribers has basically been stable (and super-low) for years and almost never changes.

So I noticed something that seems odd. During this month of August, I see lots of unconfirmed subscriptions (people who typed their email in the subscription form but never clicked the confirmation link sent to their account), and they appeared in ""batches"" (some days have a bunch, other days have nothing).

I'm suspecting this is some form of spam/abuse because I have not had any unusual traffic spikes lately. I also emailed some of these unconfirmed subscribers asking to confirm or whether they had actually subscribed, and one got back to me saying that they hadn't requested this. So indeed it seems like spam, but I don't really understand what the goal is.

Has anyone noticed anything similar? Any thoughts?

In my case I’m down with around 10% of my book and am now considering whether I should selectively publish some parts in a blog. My intention is to self publish my book

Pros of publishing parts of your book in a blog as I see:
- Start building an audience
- Instant feedback

Cons:
- Does it affect your chances of publishing if some parts are online?
- Chance of getting stolen?

Any other perspectives?

I know that's traditionally a no-no, I used to have a strictly music blog that got some success but I really just want somewhere to dump all my thoughts on interests, happening and share entertainment/music.

I'm still finding my feet with publishing blog posts, and looking for some recommendations on the following. 

My current post features a photographer and the content is at 1800 words. To go with the post I have around 18 really excellent photos of his work. So far I've used 8 of the photos throughout the post and it looks and feels really good.

But what to do with all the remaining photos? It feels like a waste to post them all in the one post, or to use a gallery. 

I was thinking of turning the post into a seperate two parter? But I worry I'll struggle to generate another 1500+ word post. Especially as I would want part two to be SEO optimised.

Could I add a 2nd page that is mainly photos and with less words? Would that help the SEO strength of the main post?

1. Time It Takes To Write, Edit, Proof, and Optimize an Article for SEO
2. Using SEO Effectively as I am having a hard time even showing up in google at all
3. Having Moments of Doubt, and Frustration   


1st reason:  
 Is partly that I already have limited time in the day as I own a small business just my wife and I, and we have 4 kids with a 5th on the way. On top of this, it takes me easily a good 10+ sometimes 20 hours or more to completely write an article start to finish with editing and SEO optimizing and everything. This is even with me already knowing exactly what I want to write as I keep a running list and even will often already have an outline with a summary of each point. It's definitely something I am working on trying to cut the time down on.  


2nd Reason:

I've watched a lot of videos and listen to podcast, read articles all on SEO and I've even been using ubersuggest and creating keyword logs in Notion to make the process of keyword research easier but still struggle to even get any organic traffic what little traffic i do get comes from social media.  


3rd Reason:

I'm embarrassed to say this but I at one point deleted my entire blog for the month of July (I started back in mid-March 2020) because I felt like I was not making progress and no one was interested in what i had to share. All my traffic was direct only not organic. Now I came back restored everything and have decided to be patient and just work on improving things little by little by taking the 1% better approach to my blog.  


My biggest fear out of all these though is that my niche isn't clear or that my niche isn't working altogether. I know people say ""find your niche"" but I already feel like I have because its something I know really well and enjoy talking about and frankly changing anything else feels like starting back over at square one. I also don't want to just do a niche because its successful because then that doesn't feel genuine not to mention I would be a completely noob on the topic making it really hard to write for.

,Blogging,"Hey there,

I'm running a blog on software development topics, and am currently developing a tool to help me grow it more by fixing some of the pains I'm having managing my blog.

The question I'm asking myself (and now you) is if other bloggers have experienced similar challenges when growing their blogs.

I would be very interested to know what your biggest challenges in growing your blogs are, so I can compare notes and maybe add some features to the tool that make it usable for others.

**So, what are your biggest challenges in growing your blog? What hinders you? What problems do you have?**

My current challenges:

* tools that support keyword research and backlink analysis and stuff like that start at $100/month. I'm not willing to pay that much (yet).
* It's arduous to find out what effect a change to a blog post had in terms of traffic. I have to keep a spreadsheet with the changes I did and have to compare manually if it has an effect over time

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m running a blog on software development topics, and am currently developing a tool to help me grow it more by fixing some of the pains I&amp;#39;m having managing my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question I&amp;#39;m asking myself (and now you) is if other bloggers have experienced similar challenges when growing their blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be very interested to know what your biggest challenges in growing your blogs are, so I can compare notes and maybe add some features to the tool that make it usable for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what are your biggest challenges in growing your blog? What hinders you? What problems do you have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tools that support keyword research and backlink analysis and stuff like that start at $100/month. I&amp;#39;m not willing to pay that much (yet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s arduous to find out what effect a change to a blog post had in terms of traffic. I have to keep a spreadsheet with the changes I did and have to compare manually if it has an effect over time&lt;/li&gt;

But yesterday, I edited this article I was ranked 5th, after doing that I  went on to Google URL inspection and re-crawled it, and just checked that I am not ranked anymore on Google Search – Like it’s not seen anywhere.

I  think I made a mistake to change the date more than the current day.  Let’s say, today is 10th August 2020, I selected 15th August 2020 and published it and later crawled it. Could that be why this article was  GONE?

This is the most accurate answer to anyone that is planning or struggling to apply for AdSense.

2 years ago I started a blog, at that time I had no idea what I was doing, the only thing that keeps me going is that ""One day, I will start making money from my blog""

I do all sort of foolish things, I even copy another person's article and paste it on my own blog, i knew nothing about SEO or ranking a blog on Google.

All I do is promote my blog contents on Facebook and get traffic to my blog, Facebook even blocked my URL for spamming.

And as months passed, I wasn't making any money from my blog and I decided to stop and learn what Blogging really is.

And here are what I've learned:

YOU NEED MANY ORGANIC TRAFFIC TO MAKE MONEY WITH ADSENSE.
Google AdSense are seriously looking for bloggers that are ready to put ads on their sites, but still, many peoples blog are rejected. Because the blogs are not having organic traffic.

YOU CAN BUILD A FRESH BLOG AND START MAKING MONEY WITH IT IN FEW WEEKS WITHOUT ADSENSE
You should forget about AdSense if you're just starting out in Blogging, my first money in Blogging was made without AdSense

YOU DON'T NEED TECHNICAL SEO TO RANK YOUR BLOG ON GOOGLE
When you search for ""Ways to enjoy browsing"", ""Four ways to enjoy browsing"", ""Enjoy browsing"" etc, I rank number 1 for that Keyword without any technical SEO. And I am getting good traffic from only that keyword.

YOU CAN BUILD A BLOG TODAY AND START MAKING MONEY IN 3 WEEKS TIME
I currently own a Facebook group where I teach new bloggers how to build their fresh new blog and make money with it in 3 weeks time without any AdSense or technical SEO.

So if you are interested in making money with AdSense, then you need to spend your time ranking your blog on Google, writing quality articles and waiting for good amount of traffic to come

If you spend your time joining visit for visit groups and sharing your links on Facebook it won't take you anywhere, Facebook will even ban your URL soon.

But if you are looking for a way to earn from your new blog, then just comment INTERESTED and I will help you out.

,Blogging,"Hey /r/blogging,

This is a re-run of the previous competition, but with fewer requirements.

If you visit our sub-reddit often, you'll see a lot of the same questions being asked over (and over - and over) again. 

We've been talking internally as mods to think of a way to create an FAQ, and we think it would be great to get the smart people of /r/blogging involved. If you want to help contribute to our FAQ (which we'll refer to often moving forward), then please read on.

**How will it work?**

**Step 1:** Choose 1 of the following questions to answer (you can answer more, just submit them separately). Each answer can be ~200 words in length (or more, it's up to you).

**The questions to choose from:**

1. What's the difference between hosting a blog using Wordpress.com and self-hosting a blog using Wordpress?
2. What are the best options to host your blog if you don't want to use Wordpress? (pros and cons of each)
3. Should you expect to make a living from blogging?
4. Why pay for blog hosting?
5. Who are some of the most reputable hosting companies?
6. What are some of the best Wordpress plugins to use? And why?
7. Why is having your own .com domain name important?
8. What are things to factor in when registering a domain name?
9. What's a pen name? What are the pros and cons of writing with a pen name?
10. What are some ways to help generate traffic to your blog?
11. What are the pros and cons of using Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Reddit to generate traffic?
12. What are some beginner SEO tips?
13. How do you structure the writing of your blog posts?
14. Are you allowed to use other people's images?
15. What are some good sources of royalty-free images?
16. How much time should you spend promoting your content vs writing it?
17. What are some ways to monetize your blog?
18. Am I allowed to use and re-write other people's content?

**Step 2:** Submit your answer via: https://forms.gle/SF8GmEMzc5myFZXN7

**Step 3:** Reply to this thread with the question you're answering (to let others know which questions need answering). 

**Things to keep in mind:**

- Multiple people can answer the same question. We'll just choose sections of the best parts to feature in the FAQ. In the FAQ your answer will be quoted alongside your Reddit username. 

- No affiliate links allowed.

- We may or may not choose your entire answer in the FAQ.


**Prizes:**

The Google form has an option whether you want your submission to enter you into the competition to win free hosting. We understand that most of you already have hosting, and that you still might want to contribute to the FAQ, so you can still make your submission and select ""no"" on the final question. 

If you're currently hosting your blog on a platform like Blogger, or wordpress.com, then this might be a good way for you to try self-hosted WordPress.

**The prizes consist of hosting (from https://cynderhost.com), they are:**

- 1 lifetime subscription to the high-performance Basic plan (100 GB bandwidth [50 GB CDN + 50 GB Origin], 20GB SSD, details) - [details](https://cynderhost.com/high-performance-hosting)

- 6-month hosting on the shared Basic plan [details](https://cynderhost.com/shared-web-hosting)

- 3-month hosting on the Basic plan [details](https://cynderhost.com/shared-web-hosting)

**Boring disclaimer stuff:** 

You must claim your subscription within 5 days of announcement, and must move your website onto our platform within 12 days, or your subscription will be void. Content you host must be compliant with our ToS, which expressly prohibits illegal, malicious, or unethical content. Prizes may be revoked at any time for violations of our policies. Due to legal reasons, we are unable to provide hosting to users in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan. We may ask you to provide your name, email, and domain in order to set up your account. Prizes are non-refundable, non-transferable, and cannot be redeemed for cash value or equivalent subscriptions except under special circumstances.

**More boring disclaimer stuff:**

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Submit your answer via: &lt;a href=""https://forms.gle/SF8GmEMzc5myFZXN7""&gt;https://forms.gle/SF8GmEMzc5myFZXN7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Reply to this thread with the question you&amp;#39;re answering (to let others know which questions need answering). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to keep in mind:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple people can answer the same question. We&amp;#39;ll just choose sections of the best parts to feature in the FAQ. In the FAQ your answer will be quoted alongside your Reddit username. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No affiliate links allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may or may not choose your entire answer in the FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prizes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google form has an option whether you want your submission to enter you into the competition to win free hosting. We understand that most of you already have hosting, and that you still might want to contribute to the FAQ, so you can still make your submission and select &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; on the final question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re currently hosting your blog on a platform like Blogger, or wordpress.com, then this might be a good way for you to try self-hosted WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prizes consist of hosting (from &lt;a href=""https://cynderhost.com""&gt;https://cynderhost.com&lt;/a&gt;), they are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 lifetime subscription to the high-performance Basic plan (100 GB bandwidth [50 GB CDN + 50 GB Origin], 20GB SSD, details) - &lt;a href=""https://cynderhost.com/high-performance-hosting""&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6-month hosting on the shared Basic plan &lt;a href=""https://cynderhost.com/shared-web-hosting""&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-month hosting on the Basic plan &lt;a href=""https://cynderhost.com/shared-web-hosting""&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boring disclaimer stuff:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must claim your subscription within 5 days of announcement, and must move your website onto our platform within 12 days, or your subscription will be void. Content you host must be compliant with our ToS, which expressly prohibits illegal, malicious, or unethical content. Prizes may be revoked at any time for violations of our policies. Due to legal reasons, we are unable to provide hosting to users in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan. We may ask you to provide your name, email, and domain in order to set up your account. Prizes are non-refundable, non-transferable, and cannot be redeemed for cash value or equivalent subscriptions except under special circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More boring disclaimer stuff:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition will run for 2 weeks, and end on the 23rd of August, but you&amp;#39;re free to continue submitting answers after the competition end date.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past year and a half I've been running a news aggregator blog via wordpress. I don't write anything myself, but just have a site where I link to external articles.

Every evening I just update it with things I noticed throughout the day. This is just a hobby of mine but I haven't gone unscathed financially throughout this COVID stuff and would like to monetize my hobby to help myself out as much as I can.

I applied to Google Adsense about a week or so ago and just got rejected because of ""scraped content."" I thought this rule only existed for sites that basically cut and pasted the text of other people's/organization's content, but apparently it applies to external links too. So that rejection was a little annoying.

That being said, I know that there's a gazillion ad networks out there that work well via wordpress sites, and based upon my research, I'm well past the threshold of page views that I need to generate a decent chunk of revenue.

Thanks for your help. I installed the recommended plugins and enabled two-factor authentication and the attempts have ground to a halt. None in the last few hours.    


  
So, I'm very new to blogging at the moment. I'm still finding my way around WP and just trying to get some regular posts up and learn as I go. Today I noticed that there have been nearly 1500 attempts to gain entry to my account. I have a very strong password, so I imagine these attempts are automated, or someone trying things like admin123, etc, but it's annoying and concerning there are dozens of these attempts a day.

I did a bit of research and I'm seeing advice about htaccess, creating honeypots, etc, and I'm getting pretty confused, to be honest.

Can someone explain like I'm 5 what I need to do, please? How does changing these things help? Do I need to create a honeypot?

Here is the advice I found...

Three things you should do for all common CMS systems (WP, Joomla, etc..)

First, change the admin directory to something else. When doing this you likely have to edit configuration files to point to the new location which is pretty simple.

Second protect admin directory with [.htaccess &amp; .htpasswd.](http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess3.shtml)  There is a nice generator I have used on some of my sites in the past [here.](http://www.oscommerce-solution.com/create_htpasswd.php)

Third, create a [honeypot/auto](http://kb.siteground.com/block_spammers_in_wordpress_through_project_honey_pot_/) IP ban for malicious crawlers or script kiddies. There are several plugins for this if you search the keywords honeypot + cms.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your help. I installed the recommended plugins and enabled two-factor authentication and the attempts have ground to a halt. None in the last few hours.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;m very new to blogging at the moment. I&amp;#39;m still finding my way around WP and just trying to get some regular posts up and learn as I go. Today I noticed that there have been nearly 1500 attempts to gain entry to my account. I have a very strong password, so I imagine these attempts are automated, or someone trying things like admin123, etc, but it&amp;#39;s annoying and concerning there are dozens of these attempts a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of research and I&amp;#39;m seeing advice about htaccess, creating honeypots, etc, and I&amp;#39;m getting pretty confused, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can someone explain like I&amp;#39;m 5 what I need to do, please? How does changing these things help? Do I need to create a honeypot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the advice I found...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three things you should do for all common CMS systems (WP, Joomla, etc..)&lt;/p&gt;

First of all I want to thank all of the posters here there has been so much useful information! When I first created my blog I did it with the intention of it being 'my brand' as a entertainer instead of a business. I decided to sell out a bit and play with some articles within the original niche of the site that would get me some ranking.

I didn't think of something though, I have a lot of random stuff on there that might be hurting my SEO. I am not sure if that's true or not but I think it is as I have articles from random thoughts I have, TV shows, hobbies, ect ect. My blog is hitting roughly 200-300 views monthly and is gaining 2-3 subscribers a day right now. I honestly never expected this to happen and now it has me hungry for more (I do know compared to a lot of people these numbers are very weak)

I am not sure if relevant or not but I always here about the '8 month timeline' and I am about 5 months in.

I was thinking about making another blog that I could 'share' articles from my hobbyist blog to a more focused blog. So for example if I write a article 'How to stand up' I can put it on both, but if I write 'here is why I actually like crimes of grindlewald' it only goes on my hobbyist blog. 

I am worried about 2 things mainly for doing this...

2.

So far nobody's bought anything. Is that normal?

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m talking about things that I can research, little tips and tricks, things to learn about, buttons/pages I can add in, quick things to do now that makes down the road easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned a tiny bit about SEO and I already have a background in Instagram Marketing. This is my first time trying to run a blog so it is completely new territory!&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"Yes, you read that correctly, I'll do everything backward moving on.

This is how I used to do things:

1. Spin-off a Linode VPS and secure it.
2. Install Docker
3. Setup multiple Docker containers with Nginx, WordPress, Mysql &amp; Let's Encrypt
4. Setup Cloudflare (CDN)
5. Setup WordPress
6. Spent hours looking for a cool template
7. Install multiple plugins and configure
8. Configure Mailchimp
9. Setup Wordfence and 2FA
10. Keep plugins updated.
11. With the energy I got left, not that much, start creating content.
12. Even with less energy, promote my blog.

Now, this is how I'm going to do moving forward:

1. Write content
2. Promote my blog

But in order to do that:

1. I'm shutting down Linode, WordPress, and everything in between.
2. Setting up a Ghost with a hosting provider, Midnight.
3. Setting up a simple template that I was able to configure in less than 1 hour.
4. Setup Cloudflare
5. Not worrying about plugins updates, Wordfence logs, failed login attempts, etc.

That's all, a plain and simple note to myself, which hopefully will help someone here.

&lt;p&gt;This is how I used to do things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spin-off a Linode VPS and secure it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup multiple Docker containers with Nginx, WordPress, Mysql &amp;amp; Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup Cloudflare (CDN)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup WordPress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent hours looking for a cool template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install multiple plugins and configure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure Mailchimp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup Wordfence and 2FA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep plugins updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the energy I got left, not that much, start creating content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even with less energy, promote my blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is how I&amp;#39;m going to do moving forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote my blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in order to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m shutting down Linode, WordPress, and everything in between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up a Ghost with a hosting provider, Midnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up a simple template that I was able to configure in less than 1 hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup Cloudflare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not worrying about plugins updates, Wordfence logs, failed login attempts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all, a plain and simple note to myself, which hopefully will help someone here.&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"Hello everyone, I guess I will try to keep up with a monthly progress report for my second site. To start off I will just explain where I am in the blogging game and then go from there.

I just started learning how to blog this year. I watched a ton of videos and then jumped right in. Technically my first website was a flop, it was a financial website that got 7 articles, and then I decided it wasn't the right niche for me. I think I will use that domain and turn it into some sort of blog website in the future. For now, I will just put my reports on there with a YouTube video, I have no time to do anything else with it.

The first real site that I count as my first site is doing excellent. I am 4 months in and it has 95 articles. It is generating over 11k visits and has made $185 in July. It made $175 in June so it is doing really well. Hopefully, I will break $200 in august but we will see.

Anyway, that's my progress so far. Now let's look at month one of my fresh domain/website and you can all follow along with my progress. I made a YouTube video for it, but it is kind of blurry, I need to adjust my OBS settings I think. here is the link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhJmqI-F5n4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhJmqI-F5n4)  sorry for the blurriness I need to work on it (I'm new to this lol)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway here are the stats

Articles: 11

Organic sessions: 7

Total sessions: 387

Earned Revenue: 10.02

Expenses: 127 +87.16

Net: -204.14

&amp;#x200B;

The 87.16 is the startup costs including a domain name and a logo. The 127 is the cost of articles. I'm trying to do a 50/50 on this site, I write half and hire half. I'd like to write even more if I can to keep the costs down on this site. I really want this site to be ROI positive really fast. I'm in the hole almost 3k on my first site so I really need to keep costs down until it starts picking up.

My goal is to write 1 article a week and then hire 1 a week. If I have more time I will do more but I am still making content for site 1 (2 a week) so that is around 4 articles per week. I still have a full-time job so that is a lot for me.

The reason my total sessions are so high is that I made a post on Reddit that did very well. It was basically a beginner buying guide and this niche is growing in popularity so lots of noobies. They ate it up and made some purchases. I made a nice $10 in commissions which was amazing. I made another post a week later but it didn't do quite as good. I will post every now and then when I think it will generate some traffic. but my main focus is on SEO and organic traffic.

Let me know if there is anything else I should be including in these reports for next time. I am still getting the hang of it and hopefully, I didn't do too bad. I hope this helps someone and encourages you to get started.

**Stats**

* 78 posts
* 6-8 new posts per month. (last month I went crazy and did 20)
* GSC monthly: 55k impressions + 2700 clicks. (exited the Google sandbox about 3 months ago)
* GA monthly: 3k sessions 
* Bing and Twitter account for the remaining 300 sessions. It appears I just exited the Bing sandbox - 3 months behind Google

**Process**

* Post backlog: \~400 posts in the backlog right now and I'm constantly adding to it.
* How I pick what to write: On a weekly basis I pick 5 random posts. Any I fail to complete that week I throw back in the backlog.
* I write for about 1 hour every morning.
* When I publish, I tweet the link, targeting my niche. This brings in a lil bit of traffic, and may expose me to backlinkers, so the small effort is worth it.
* I know my target audience. They are just like me. They use Chrome, desktop, are in and out (they just want an answer to a specific problem and are in a hurry), and they search during business hours (they are solving problems at work).

**GSC - Core Web Vitals**

After I exited the Google sandbox 3 months ago, they showed all my URLs as loading too slowly (moderate / yellow). I worked on the performance and used GTMetrix to test changes. Then I checked back in a month and saw all my URLs were now considered good (green) in GSC.

I used two plugins that solved the problem:

1. reSmush image optimizer. This compresses my images by 60%.

For instance, if you’re a healthcare professional, start blogging about fitness, natural remedies, etc., if you’re a fitness freak, start creating content on workouts, healthy hacks, lessons from bodybuilding pros, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, writing about your own profession, you’re not only building your own portfolio, but staying intact with the ins and outs and trends of your field. Hence, alleviating the chances of burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"Hi all,

I'm sort of new to the website/blogging world so I hope I have done this right! Please bear with me over the coming weeks and months as I am sure that I will get to grips with it before long...

I started a news website in a niche which I am very interested in - technology. The website has a lot of different content as we have since expanded since the launch. Me and some of my friends, with the same interests as me, keep this website up to date by writing articles daily which we then share on various social media accounts (mostly Facebook and Twitter).

**Monthly Summary**

This month was the month we launched; and for the first month, it wasn't bad. We pushed out plenty of content and began to see a good amount of traffic coming to our website (mainly from social media. The money from advertisements came in and has helped us 'break even' so far. 

We have been experimenting with different ways of pushing our content to people through social media.

Initially, the website only had news on technology. Since the launch, we have expanded into lots of different categories (11 in total). These include gaming, photography, finance, business and startups.

**What went well?**

* I think the amount of traffic we received was exceptional and exceeded my expectations for the first month. 
* The amount of content we produced also exceeded our expectations too. We kept up to date with all of the latest news and also produced some extra pieces like case studies on people!

**What could be improved?**

* The earnings could be significantly increased. We are earning next to nothing for the amount of visitors we are getting. I have been in contact with my ad networks and they are helping me optimise my website but until then, we will have to live with what we have...
* We never really game much thought to the design of the website. It may look good and modern but I think it could be made better. Eventually, I will completely re-design the website to be exactly how I want it. This will make it easier to navigate and professionally looking.

**Statistics**

|Metric|July 2020|
|:-|:-|
|Users|10395|
|Sessions|10667|
|Page Views|11204|
|Average Time on Page|2 minutes 8 seconds|

**User Acquisition** 

Thought it would be a good idea to include this to show where we get the majority of our viewers from. Most of them come from Facebook. The amount of direct traffic is quite surprising though.

|Medium|Percentage|
|:-|:-|
|Social|93.1%|
|Direct|5.7%|
|Organic|0.8%|
|Referral|0.4%|

**Revenue**

We have 3 different ad networks set up on our website to try and earn a bit more. Eventually, we will be removing 2 of them and having one primary source.

I am extremely disappointed by these results however hope to increase them over the coming months.

|Source|Earnings|
|:-|:-|
|Adsense|$0.34|
|Media.net|$1.95|
|Infolinks|$1.05|
|Total|$3.34|

**Google Search Console**

Our CTR is exceptionally low and over the next month I would like to help increase it. 

|Metric|Value|
|:-|:-|
|Impressions|83511|
|Clicks|88|
|CTR|0.1%|
|Average Position|10.5|

**Goals for next month**

* SEO -  Over the next month, I would like to improve the SEO of the website and optimise it for search engines.
* Increase Organic Traffic - This sort of leads on from the previous goal but I would like to get some more organic traffic onto the website. 
* 15,000 sessions - I'm pushing the boat out a bit with this one but fingers crossed!
* Guest blogs and independently find advertisers  -  Another way to get some revenue in is to charge people to write guest blogs and find small businesses or websites who want to advertise on our website.
* Use other social medias - To get more traffic, we are planning to expand our presence onto other social media platforms than Twitter and Facebook.
* Begin to use affiliate links - Next month, we are hoping to begin to use affiliate links to increase the revenue.
* Increase returning visitors - Not really sure how I'm going to do this but I will give it a go and try different strategies. 

**Questions**

* Is building back links worth it?
* Which other ways can we monetise our website?
* Best SEO plugins on WordPress

Any other bits of helpful information would be appreciated too! 

**Conclusion**

I know that my website isn't the best or earning the most but I am still learning. I am still getting to grips with the whole blogging concept despite being around the scene for some while. This is my first proper venture and am still learning as I go on.

,Blogging,"Just about 13 days ago, I posted an introduction and goals for my niche website.

I decided to make this update, so I can start giving this community updates at the end of every month.

I started my niche website on May 18th, 2020, here was the first update:

* [Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/htol9t/my_new_journey_day_61_lesson_stats_goals/)

Several members asked that I continue updating my journey, so here goes!

**Since my update, I had**:

* 63,504 words
* 48 articles
* 0 earnings
* 1-2 organic traffic a day

**Now, I have**:

* 92,412 words
* 68 articles
* 0 earnings
* 3-4 organic traffic a day

In my last update, I didn't update my monthly stats, so here it is.

Keep in mind that I started this website on May 18th.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Month | Published | Total Articles | Organic Traffic | Rank KW On Ahref | Total Words**

1. **May 2020** | 10 P | 10 TA | 2 OT (bot traffic?) |??? | 14,260 Words
2. **June 2020** | 15 P | 25 TA | 13 OT | ??? |40,323 Words
3. **July 2020** | 43 P | 68 TA | 47 OT | 84 KW | 92,412 Words

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**July Goals**

At the beginning of July, I set a goal to achieve 50+ articles on my website. *Mission accomplished.*

As you can see, I stepped it up in July.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**August Goals**

For my August goals, I'm looking forward to having 150 articles published.

I have ordered 60,000 words of money articles for my website since I'm terrible at writing those.

I'm also testing my other writers (5 at the moment).

As for informational articles, I can push out easily 3\~4 a day. I usually go all out once every two days.

So that means that I have to publish 82 articles to achieve my goal.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What I'm Proud Of:**

When building my first website nearly two years ago, I barely made it to 100,000 words on there. With his niched site, I'm proud that I made it to almost 100,000 words in less than three months.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Quality &gt; Quantity**

I agree with this. It might seem like I'm rushing things, but I can tell you that I put time into formatting and making my articles nice/readable. I make sure that my writers are giving me accurate information.

To give you an idea, I usually sit on my chair for 8+ hours on days where I focus only on blogging.

If I were to calculate the hours of work in July, I'm positive it's over 120+ hours.

I would like to thank my private blogging group for guiding me every step of the way. Without these guys, I wouldn't have been here. So shoutout to some of the members on here!

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**I'm looking forward to...**

I'm looking forward to becoming another inspirational story to this community one day! :)

And I'm looking forward to everyone's case studies and journeys!

&lt;p&gt;I decided to make this update, so I can start giving this community updates at the end of every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my niche website on May 18th, 2020, here was the first update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/htol9t/my_new_journey_day_61_lesson_stats_goals/""&gt;Update #1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several members asked that I continue updating my journey, so here goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since my update, I had&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;63,504 words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;48 articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-2 organic traffic a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, I have&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;92,412 words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;68 articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 earnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-4 organic traffic a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last update, I didn&amp;#39;t update my monthly stats, so here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that I started this website on May 18th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Month | Published | Total Articles | Organic Traffic | Rank KW On Ahref | Total Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2020&lt;/strong&gt; | 10 P | 10 TA | 2 OT (bot traffic?) |??? | 14,260 Words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2020&lt;/strong&gt; | 15 P | 25 TA | 13 OT | ??? |40,323 Words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2020&lt;/strong&gt; | 43 P | 68 TA | 47 OT | 84 KW | 92,412 Words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of July, I set a goal to achieve 50+ articles on my website. &lt;em&gt;Mission accomplished.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I stepped it up in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my August goals, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to having 150 articles published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have ordered 60,000 words of money articles for my website since I&amp;#39;m terrible at writing those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also testing my other writers (5 at the moment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for informational articles, I can push out easily 3~4 a day. I usually go all out once every two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that means that I have to publish 82 articles to achieve my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I&amp;#39;m Proud Of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building my first website nearly two years ago, I barely made it to 100,000 words on there. With his niched site, I&amp;#39;m proud that I made it to almost 100,000 words in less than three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality &amp;gt; Quantity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with this. It might seem like I&amp;#39;m rushing things, but I can tell you that I put time into formatting and making my articles nice/readable. I make sure that my writers are giving me accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea, I usually sit on my chair for 8+ hours on days where I focus only on blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to calculate the hours of work in July, I&amp;#39;m positive it&amp;#39;s over 120+ hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank my private blogging group for guiding me every step of the way. Without these guys, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have been here. So shoutout to some of the members on here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking forward to...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking forward to becoming another inspirational story to this community one day! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m looking forward to everyone&amp;#39;s case studies and journeys!&lt;/p&gt;

**Monthly Summary**

I'll be honest, I did very little this month. I even didn't really pay too much attention to my positions, or my visitors. 

I was very busy with my main job, and also had lots of personal life stuff going on, so I just decided to sit back and see what happened.

To my surprise, several of my previously written articles have obviously shot up in popularity. There was one article which I believe must have been shared in a Facebook Group or similar, as my Facebook traffic to that post had a huge spike in the middle of the month, where I almost received 1,000 visitors in a single day!

My average visitors per day started the month at around 100-140 I would say. While now I'm consistently getting 350+ days with the occasional spike on more traffic heavy days going above 800 visitors.

**Monthly Stats:**  [Image Link](https://imgur.com/gallery/6dMSRf1)

As you can see, my monthly visitors have absolutely rocketed since last month. This, admittedly, is down to 3 or 4 main posts which have significantly increased.

The downside of this, is I would say only one of those posts is really core to my niche, while the others are just general information posts which are slightly related.

&amp;#x200B;

**Aim for Upcoming Month**

I am only going to aim to write 4 really in-depth posts this month, with around 3,000 words each. This means I can focus on quality rather than quantity.

**Goals**

* My goal of 2,000 sessions for July was absolutely obliterated. I almost hit 9,000!
* My aim for August is to remain consistent. I suspect one of the big posts may lose steam, as it is super relevant right now, but may not be in a months time. I hope to get between 5,000 and 10,000 sessions again
* I am starting to see some diversification of visitors. No longer focussed into one main post, but into 4 or 5. The post with the most visitors per day on average changed this month as well. So hopefully over time this diversification will continue to improve.
* I've pretty much given up with Pinterest. If anyone has some advice please send it my way, otherwise I think I'll stop posting on it.",t2_279lxrn1,False,,0,False,Case Study - Finance Niche Blog (Month 4) - Seems like progress is being made!,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tips/Info'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Tipsinfo,0,,False,t3_i1oabo,False,dark,0.91,,public,9,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Info,False,9,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1596295636.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/gc32gq/case_study_finance_niche_blog_month_1_join_the/""&gt;Month 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be my first attempt creating something on the web and I have some noob questions, such as: for this purpose is it better to use static pages (that will be modified if needed) or to publish blog posts and categorize them? Which platform is better in this case (I have basic skills of CSS, HTML and Javascript, I am learning)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this is the right sub for this question, in case please let me know if there is one better. I want to create something on the web to learn how to manage it by working on a real project.&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"Hi Guys/Ladies,

I'm planning to start a website about Boating/RVing and probably will add other related outdoor activities in the near future. But I will, however, focus on boating for the first year or so.

I'm having a really difficult time to come up with a domain name. I think there's no way for me to come up with a domain name that will suggest the site is about boating or rving, and so, I decided to go broad and have a nicer domain.

After 2 days of brainstorming the best option I have right now is [OutdoorLiner.com](https://OutdoorLiner.com).

If I may, can you please share some thoughts on the following?

1. Do you think going broader with the domain name is a good idea?
2. Do you have any domain name suggestions?
3. Giving the fact that the domain name I have found doesn't refer to boating or campers, specifically, do you think is a drawback or should I go with it.

Personally, I really like the domain name but not sure if it fits the purpose of the blog.

Thank you very much,

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m planning to start a website about Boating/RVing and probably will add other related outdoor activities in the near future. But I will, however, focus on boating for the first year or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m having a really difficult time to come up with a domain name. I think there&amp;#39;s no way for me to come up with a domain name that will suggest the site is about boating or rving, and so, I decided to go broad and have a nicer domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2 days of brainstorming the best option I have right now is &lt;a href=""https://OutdoorLiner.com""&gt;OutdoorLiner.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may, can you please share some thoughts on the following?&lt;/p&gt;

**My Blog:**

* Posts: 42
* Average word count: about 1300 words
* Pageviews: 1720
* Sessions: 490 (236 direct, 199 social, 54 organic, 1 referral)
* Users: 270

**Social Media:**

*Pinterest:*

* Monthly Visitors: 4.2k
* Followers: 3

*Instagram:*

* 380 followers

**Earnings:**

*Amazon Affiliate Links:* 

* Clicks: 98
* Sales: 1
* Total Earnings: £8 

I think I got lucky with my one Amazon Affiliate sale tbh. 

**My Strategy:**

I'm not really sure how to describe my strategy atm because I'm still trying to establish a good strategy. 

So atm I just try to look for keywords using the WMS Everywhere chrome plugin, answerthepublic and Ubersuggest and I use Rankmath for SEO.

I promote my blog on Pinterest and Instagram and sometimes link to it on subreddits relevant to my niche.

I don't have an E-Mail list yet, and I'm a bit hesitant because MailChimp will show my home address in my E-Mails. So, if you have any advice on how to make an E-Mail list without leaking my home address that would be super helpful.

**My goals for next month are:**

* Publish 25 posts
* 600 Sessions
* 2 Amazon Affiliate sales
* Further grow social media accounts
* E-Mail list

**See my updated comment below, in the edit**

Was looking at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/gbebxm/ezoic_vs_mediavine_vs_adthrive/) from 2 mos ago where /u/charlestoncrafted  volunteers

&gt; Last April I had a session RPM of over $35. This year it is around $16 due to covid budget cuts. I had about 280k sessions last month

I'm doing math on this and my brain melted

~~RPMs are based on ad impressions.  Question, if multiple ads on a page, each one counts as an impression, right?~~

~~So 280k sessions, equals what...  400k page views?~~

~~lets just go with conservative 350k~~  

~~Ads on a page... conservative again. two per page~~  

~~350,000 page views x 2 ad impressions = 700,000 impressions.~~  

~~700,000 = 700m~~ 

~~Drumroll please~~ 

~~High $35 RPM:   700x35 = $24,500 per month~~  
~~Low $16 RPM:   700x 16 = $11,200 per month~~  

~~Does this math hold up?~~  

 I am not at that level of sessions, but some decent fraction below it... but I could do so much more with more effort, driven by the desire for real cash

**EDIT**: Found this page  https://www.mediavine.com/mediavine-rpm/

&gt; For example, let’s say over the last 30 days, you made $1200 and had 100,000 sessions. You would then have a $12 Session RPM. ($1200 / 100,000) * 1000 = $12.00 RPM

So their RPM is session based.  The OP clearly calls that out, and I copied it into this post.  My brain didnt connect with it!    Takes out page views and number of ads i guess.  Math above becomes much more simple.

280,000 sessions

High $35 RPM:   280x35 = $9,800 per month  
Low $16 RPM:   700x 16 = $4,480 per month

,Blogging,"Hello,  I have not yet started blogging yet, but am in the process of exploring the idea.  I watched a video on YouTube that claimed putting Google Adsense ads on a blog could be profitable.  All the other videos I have seen on making a profit with blogging had used affiliate marketing as the monetization method and I had always lacked the self-confidence at blogging to believe I could get anyone to sign up to an affiliate offer.  Using Adsense for monetization does not feel as intimidating to me for whatever reason and that video helped rekindle my interest in trying use monetized blogging to establish an income stream.

There are three niches I could enjoy writing in and have some experience with: computer programming, web development, and e-commerce (such as Shopify).  

I went to Google's Adsense Profit Calculation Estimation tool, which gave me these figures:  
LOCATION: North America  
MONTHLY PAGE VIEWS: 100,000  
NICHE: Computers And Technology = $9,400 per year profit  
NICHE: Internet And Telecom = $17,000 per year profit   
NICHE: Financial = $38,000 year profit 

(I am assuming that a blog about computer programming would fall under Computers and Tech, web development would fall under Internet and Telecom and e-commerce would fall under Financial.)

I am wondering the following: 

1. Are these figures realistic?  
2. Is 100,000 monthly page views for a blog difficult to attain with 20-30 hours of work put in per week over a matter of months?  (I am used to thinking in terms of monthly shoppers for an ecommerce store.  100,000 monthly shoppers is difficult to attain but certainly not impossible.  When it comes to monthly page views on a blog, I have no experience to draw from in order to know whether 100,000 is attainable or if it is nearly impossible, etc.)

Not that this relates to my question, but the idea of pouring my heart into creating blog content for months and then slapping those ugly, tacky Adsense ads on the page is depressing --- however, I am surely willing to due it in order to have a way of getting out of the near poverty I have fallen into.  The other unrelated point is that I spent 3 years trying to develop Android apps and as soon as I added Adsense ads to my apps I found that those ads (for apps) pay about $.005 per click.  I never made a penny and lost 3 years to it.  In the face of that, I want to do at least some research into whether there is much (if any) chance to make profit with blogging before starting out on 6-24 months of work towards it!

Recently I was thinking about how much I miss live journal. And I wanted to make a blog that also acted as a place to store my photos. I’d like to get into photography more, and post them somewhere that isn’t a social media platform. Ideally I wanted a menu bar with different albums, and a blog section.

He set me up with something called corner stone. And I am completely lost. It looks like it’s supposed to be easy drag and drop, but it just isn’t. And I’m seeing a lot of spots that require me to enter CSS coding.

I was wondering if it would be better to start over again with something like Wix? Or is there a way I can remove corner stone and easily figure this out?

I recently purchased a site that has a lot of contents but the direction is sort of all over the place. The site is about personal finances and frugal living/shopping tips. After studying about SEO, I feel like I should really break these to 2 niche sites. 

 **Personal Finances** 

This part of content has about 80 articles talking about personal finances, debt-paying stuff. It has about 2 graphics that ranked 3rd and 4th on some SEO searches. Almost none from social media. 

**Frugal living/shopping tips**

This part has about 40 articles. This includes one keyword snippet post that is generating most of the traffic for this site and the other 15 keywords (very tiny volume) ranked between 5-10. 

Idea is to keep the frugal living/shopping tips posts on the site and move the rest to a new site, organize them etc. My question is - if I move posts out, will the current site lose its ranks? (Since the blog will have only 40 posts instead of 120 something). Anyone know a good way to do this? The personal finance part also has some good enough performing keywords I would like to keep.

,Blogging,"Hey r/Blogging my name's Sah and I've got a breakdown for you.

I’ve got 1,600 people on my Substack email list, and I’ve tried out the heavy hitters like Mail Chimp and ConvertKit - I’ve done a great breakdown on how usable Substack can be for beginner bloggers vs other marketing platforms.

[Substack](https://substack.com/) is free, it's built *as a content-platform* rather than a *marketing tool* so it lacks a lot of automation and customisation that you'll get on [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), and [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) \- the problem is that those heavy hitters aren't free, and once you go over a certain amount of subscribers, you'll start paying. 

And a lot of the time, you actually don't need any of those tools.

Here’s the gist:

* If you’re not planning on selling things out the gate, and you’re only creating content.
* If you’re not concerned about having a unique look and feel for your newsletter.
* If you’re ok with having basic analytics and no automation.
* If you’re all good with having your landing page live on someone else's domain.

Then Substack will do you just fine - because A it’s free, and B it has a great system/editor that’ll allow you to quickly set up a landing page, build your list, and send out emails.

I'm suggesting it to people who are just starting out blogging because I feel that when you start, you don't need all the bells and whistles just yet.

It definitely depends on your goals, whether you're trying to convert people to buy a course, or you're setting up some other sort of digital product. I've done a [full breakdown here](https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-good-is-substack-for-your-email-newsletter-bf855f659bb?source=---------4------------------) with a lot of other useful material, experiences, screenshots, and decision making on how I arrived at this conclusion.

I hope this post helped you out though, it's got the essential points and everything else you need.

Selecting an email platform can be difficult when starting, it sure was for me.

,Blogging,"Hello everyone, I recently asked for some advice here on the best way to update old articles in order to grow my traffic after recently being hit by the Google updates, and losing a big chunk of my traffic (ouch).

I figured I will turn this into a case study for 2 reasons;

1. To hopefully help others in a similar position.
2. To keep me accountable and on track (it’s going to be a grind).

To give a short brief, the site is in a hobby niche and currently has around 400 articles. I actually bought this site about 4 years ago as a learning project, it had around 25 articles on it when I first acquired it, and if memory serves me right it was earning about $200 USD per month from Amazon.

The site has been my learning platform and my part-time side gig, I have tried lots of different strategies with the site though my key focus has generally been targeting long-tail keywords ('best', 'how', 'why', 'what', etc).

This is the first time I have experienced such a dramatic traffic drop from a Google update, and the timing could not be worse with the knock-on impact the current COVID situation is having on me financially, but onwards and upwards.

[\[Here is a quick summary of the sites traffic, to give a visual picture here\]](https://i.imgur.com/n3xryFE.png)

The site is monetized with Amazon (which was great before the commission updates from 8% to 3%), Mediavine, and also an e-book I put together (which doesn’t generate much, I just wanted to learn how to make an e-book).

**Prior to Amazon changes and Google updates**, the site was consistently generating;

$1500-$2000 per month from Mediavine.

$2000 - $2500 per month from Amazon (US/UK/Canada)

**In the current state, I am estimating;**

Approx $700-$900 per month from Mediavine

Approx $600 per month from Amazon (US/UK/Canada)

&amp;#x200B;

**The Plan**

My plan is to do a full audit of the site which will consist of;

1. Pulling data for my whole site from Search Console for the last 30 days, so I can see which articles are getting traffic, and which are doing nothing.
2. Pulling data from Google Analytics using month VS month, so I can see which articles have been impacted the most (%) from the Google update.
3. Compile the above into a master Google doc and create tabs;
   1. **\[All Articles\]**: All articles, from Search console. Filtered from the highest traffic to 0 traffic articles.
   2. **\[Update/Rewrite\]**: Articles that targeted a good, rank-able keyword but my content is not up to par, and requires either an update or full re-write to rank better / grow existing traffic.
   3. **\[301/Combine\]**: Where I have either targeted the wrong keyword or duplicated on a topic by mistake.

For duplication, I will merge the articles together, update the content, and do a 301 redirect to the article/URL that makes the most sense.

For wrong keywords aka bad research at the time, I will write a new article targeting a better-suited keyword (if it makes sense) and 301 redirect the old to the new.

4. **\[Delete\]**: Where I targeted a really bad keyword that I never had a chance of ranking for and shouldn’t have targeted in the first place. This will either be due to bad keyword research (at the time, we all have to start from somewhere!) Or just crazy competition.

If I am not able to find a workable alternative keyword, then I will just simply delete these, and 301 redirect to my homepage.

5. **\[Traffic drop\]**: I will paste in the Google Analytics data here (month VS month) showing the traffic drop for each particular article, just as a reference point. This will be particularly helpful for my higher traffic articles that have lost some traction.

So in short, I will work through the \[All articles\] tab and review each article/keyword individually so I can filter them into Update/rewrite, 301/Combine, and Delete/301 to the homepage.

Once I have reviewed an article, I will highlight it on my \[all articles\] tab so I know it’s been reviewed, add some comments and move onto the next one to review.

For the update/rewrite tab, I will be adding some extra fields:

* URL.
* Comments.
* Keyword.
* Search volume (keywords everywhere).
* Current rank.
* Competition rating.

For the competition rating, I will be doing a manual check of the page 1 competition and give each a rating out of 10 on how achievable I think the keyword is to rank for. I will be looking at;

* DA/PA of the sites on page 1 (using Moz bar).
* How many sites are specifically targeting the keyword/in H1.
* Types of sites on page 1 (i.e. forums/Q&amp;A etc)

Once I have run through all of the articles on the site, I will;

* Work through the update/rewrite tab one by one, focusing on the lowest competition ones first (using my rating as a guideline).
* Delete the lost cause keyword articles, and just 301 the article to my homepage.
* Lastly, work through the 301/combine articles.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I’m going to handle the article updates/re-writes;**

The main way I’m going to approach this is;

1. Doing a manual review of the top 3-5 ranking sites to identify what topics I have missed and to get general content expansion ideas.
2. Use Surfer SEO tool to see what relevant terms I am missing, word count guidelines, and other on-page SEO recommendations. I will not follow this religiously and just try to apply common sense.
3. Google Search console, I will pull the data for each article from search console to see what I am currently ranking for on the bottom of page 1 and 2 of Google (focusing on highest impression terms) and try to work in missing related keywords (when it makes sense to do so).
4. Google related searches/People also ask, to get some missed topic ideas.
5. Answer The Public, as a back up if I need further ideas.
6. If I am doing a full re-write, then I will probably just use Surfer SEO’s content editor.

Where I have covered lots of long-tail/question-related keywords, I need to be super careful I do not duplicate topics when expanding existing articles out (note to self).

&amp;#x200B;

**Internal linking**

While doing the article updates I am also going to try and revisit internal linking, previously I have just tried to add a few internal links (to and from) when publishing new articles and never really had much of a strategy here.

I need to work out the best way of doing this manually, but just going to try to increase the number of internal links that I have, and make sure all relevant articles are linking to and from each other (where it makes sense).

I was thinking about just doing a list of like say 8-10 related article internal links at the bottom of each article so I have mini-groups for each relevant category. Then repeat the process for other category areas, may need to revisit this but just an initial idea.

&amp;#x200B;

**My expectations**

I’m really not sure how this is going to turn out but I would be very happy if;

1. I can get my traffic levels back to 3000+ visitors per day.
2. I can get my earnings to $2500 per month between Amazon and Mediavine.

Whatever happens, I’m sure this will be a good learning project but time will tell.

I will try to keep a monthly update format going forwards, though I don’t expect anything too exciting to happen for a couple of months as the initial audit is going to be very time-consuming.",t2_1pzxh46e,False,,0,False,Updating Content: Case Study [Month 1],"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tips/Info'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Tipsinfo,0,,False,t3_hvpred,False,dark,1.0,,public,38,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Info,False,38,,False,,1595410366.0,,[],{},,True,,1595433824.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, I recently asked for some advice here on the best way to update old articles in order to grow my traffic after recently being hit by the Google updates, and losing a big chunk of my traffic (ouch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured I will turn this into a case study for 2 reasons;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To hopefully help others in a similar position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep me accountable and on track (it’s going to be a grind).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a short brief, the site is in a hobby niche and currently has around 400 articles. I actually bought this site about 4 years ago as a learning project, it had around 25 articles on it when I first acquired it, and if memory serves me right it was earning about $200 USD per month from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site has been my learning platform and my part-time side gig, I have tried lots of different strategies with the site though my key focus has generally been targeting long-tail keywords (&amp;#39;best&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;how&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;why&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;what&amp;#39;, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I have experienced such a dramatic traffic drop from a Google update, and the timing could not be worse with the knock-on impact the current COVID situation is having on me financially, but onwards and upwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/n3xryFE.png""&gt;[Here is a quick summary of the sites traffic, to give a visual picture here]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is monetized with Amazon (which was great before the commission updates from 8% to 3%), Mediavine, and also an e-book I put together (which doesn’t generate much, I just wanted to learn how to make an e-book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prior to Amazon changes and Google updates&lt;/strong&gt;, the site was consistently generating;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$1500-$2000 per month from Mediavine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$2000 - $2500 per month from Amazon (US/UK/Canada)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the current state, I am estimating;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approx $700-$900 per month from Mediavine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approx $600 per month from Amazon (US/UK/Canada)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to do a full audit of the site which will consist of;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulling data for my whole site from Search Console for the last 30 days, so I can see which articles are getting traffic, and which are doing nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pulling data from Google Analytics using month VS month, so I can see which articles have been impacted the most (%) from the Google update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile the above into a master Google doc and create tabs;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[All Articles]&lt;/strong&gt;: All articles, from Search console. Filtered from the highest traffic to 0 traffic articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Update/Rewrite]&lt;/strong&gt;: Articles that targeted a good, rank-able keyword but my content is not up to par, and requires either an update or full re-write to rank better / grow existing traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[301/Combine]&lt;/strong&gt;: Where I have either targeted the wrong keyword or duplicated on a topic by mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For duplication, I will merge the articles together, update the content, and do a 301 redirect to the article/URL that makes the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For wrong keywords aka bad research at the time, I will write a new article targeting a better-suited keyword (if it makes sense) and 301 redirect the old to the new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Delete]&lt;/strong&gt;: Where I targeted a really bad keyword that I never had a chance of ranking for and shouldn’t have targeted in the first place. This will either be due to bad keyword research (at the time, we all have to start from somewhere!) Or just crazy competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am not able to find a workable alternative keyword, then I will just simply delete these, and 301 redirect to my homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Traffic drop]&lt;/strong&gt;: I will paste in the Google Analytics data here (month VS month) showing the traffic drop for each particular article, just as a reference point. This will be particularly helpful for my higher traffic articles that have lost some traction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, I will work through the [All articles] tab and review each article/keyword individually so I can filter them into Update/rewrite, 301/Combine, and Delete/301 to the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I have reviewed an article, I will highlight it on my [all articles] tab so I know it’s been reviewed, add some comments and move onto the next one to review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the update/rewrite tab, I will be adding some extra fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search volume (keywords everywhere).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current rank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition rating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the competition rating, I will be doing a manual check of the page 1 competition and give each a rating out of 10 on how achievable I think the keyword is to rank for. I will be looking at;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DA/PA of the sites on page 1 (using Moz bar).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many sites are specifically targeting the keyword/in H1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of sites on page 1 (i.e. forums/Q&amp;amp;A etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I have run through all of the articles on the site, I will;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work through the update/rewrite tab one by one, focusing on the lowest competition ones first (using my rating as a guideline).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete the lost cause keyword articles, and just 301 the article to my homepage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, work through the 301/combine articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I’m going to handle the article updates/re-writes;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"Hi all

I have wanted to ask this question for so long, maybe years, but never actually asked it. My question is simple - does affiliate marketing work for any type of blog? 

For example, a travel blog. Sure it works, because the ads can show products related to traveling that the audience can buy, such as a travel bag, a flashlight, a metal bottle of water, etc. The price of each of those items is about less than $100. This is fine.

Another example, a skincare blog. Affiliate marketing also works here because the ads can be relevant to the audience - the ads can show skincare products, lotions, body cream, etc. Again, the price of each of those items is about less than $100.

However, let's say a car blog. How does affiliate marketing work here? Are the ads going to be showing cars for sale? Now, obviously showing cars as ads is not feasible because they cost so expensive (most likely $5,000+ ) compared to things like travel bags, lotions, moisturizers, etc. So what happens in this case? Surely the audience won't click on the ad, hoping to buy a car? This is much more realistic with travel bags/body cream/flashlight, but surely not with a car?

So my question is, as shown in the example above, a car blog is not suitable for affiliate marketing due to the example shown above.

Hi guys,

1. I am in the process of writing a reviews site with around 100 articles, each for 2000 words. The site is about the cryptocurrencies.
2. I usually use the word ""Conclusion"" for the last section. I provided the ""bottom-line"" conclusions in it.
3. I know that we are advised to be LSI about our writing and try to signal to both meatbags and our masters, search engines, that we are writing about the stuff we are writing about and not about daffodils.
4. So, I am thinking about the ways how replace the word ""Conclusion"".
5. I think that I want to use the same language for all articles, i.e. not different phrases.
6. Example:

***Topic:***

IOTA cryptocurrency review

***Conclusion subheading, options:***

IOTA: Verdict

IOTA: Bottom Line

IOTA: Conclusion

IOTA: TLDR (though this one should be at the top, maybe?)

IOTA: Elevator Pitch

IOTA: Сrib / Crib Note / Cheatsheet

IOTA: Viagra Pill

IOTA: Parachute Ring

IOTA: Core

IOTA: Meat

IOTA: Nuts and Bolt

IOTA: Recap

IOTA: In Case You Missed It

IOTA: In Case It Missed You

IOTA: Nutshell

IOTA: Roundup

IOTA: Wrap-Up

IOTA: Post-Readus

IOTA: Bullets (this would mean the following: i) I would write 5-8 bullets that I find most important, ii) I would act like this at every article, iii) hopefully, readers would find this useful, i.e. (1) they would scroll down to the bottom to read the Bullets first, (2) they would know that there are bullets at the end, (3) they would know that it's our site that has the bullets, while others don't do this (they really don't).

,Blogging,"This is going to be weird and not something that works for everyone, but I just wanted to share my experience with this. 

I’ve been running my blog very intensely since November, keeping up a rigorous publishing schedule and generally getting a lot of stuff out there. I hate promoting stuff, but if I want readers, I need to do so. So I am active with the following social media networks:

1) Facebook—I run a page connected to my account and sometimes share in groups related to my niche if I’m proud enough of it. 
2) Reddit—I post in related subreddits, but am in contact with mods in some groups to avoid spamming. 
3) Tumblr—I run a tumblr connected to my account.
4) Twitter—I run a twitter connected to my account. 
5) Instagram—I run a rarely-used instagram to promote my blog. I should do better on that one 😬
6) Pinterest—I have an account, but I struggle to figure it out, so that’s kind of a drag. 

So with these five social networks, here are some observations and recommendations:

-I’ve seen people shit on Twitter in here and that’s fair, but ironically that’s where I get the most direct interaction with fans. I don’t have a ton of followers, but they reply to my links and we talk some. I also got a few things retweeted for Follow Friday by a podcaster in my niche, which caused a massive twitter surge and made it my third-biggest source of traffic after organic traffic and Facebook. 
-Facebook page is harder to moderate than you’d think! Sharing in groups, though, is the easiest way to get short-term traffic in my experience. It’s even helped me have a few of my posts go viral within my niche! Not much and please don’t trade this for SEO, but it’s a good place to start. I get most of my traffic from there, but searches will probably catch up to it within a couple years. 
-Reddit doesn’t get a ton of traffic, but it’s not nothing, and because my niche is small and the relevant subreddits are small, the traffic tends to come in for a bit more time than Twitter or Facebook.
-Tumblr and instagram have been ridiculously low-yield. Like, I’m up to over 17,000 yearly views and just 1 is from Instagram. Just six are from tumblr. To be fair, I put very little effort in there because I’ve had more success with the above three…
-Pinterest. A lot of people suggest that, but I can’t get it to work for me. I’ve had a few people pin stuff from my blogs which has gotten me some traffic. 

Anyway, this is just what works for me as a novice-but-not-newbie blogger. If you only have time for one or two social networks, try Facebook and Twitter. Tumblr and instagram are maybe worth considering later when you’ve got some more time and are willing to put more effort in. Reddit is up to you.

So, I had applied for a website who were looking for interns. They accepted and provided me 12 weeks of internship( I had to write at least one article everyweek). The first week I write an article and they published it the day after. I was excited.

So, even before the second week ended, I send them second article, but they did not reply. I waited patiently and wrote 2 more articles and send them but they did not reply to my mails. I then went to their facebook page and asked for the review to which they said, Because of Corona Virus pandemic, they are having trouble monitoring the site, and also they have become a different site.

3 weeks later I did get review, saying my second article will be published soon.However, my third and fourth were rejected as they had enough content on the topic. The third article was on ""Things to do in quaratine"" where I had listed 10 things to do in quaratine period.

I somehow remained faithful to the site even though they ignored me and send them some other articles. By the time, I send them 9th article, I was not sure if it was even worth sending them. To my shock my 5th article was published in the former site(The site I first applied to as intern and the site before merger). 

I eventually stopped sending them articles after I reached 10. 

I message their facebook page and mail the website but they don't reply at all. Now, I am not saying my articles are mindblowing and the best of all, but it would have been nice to hear from them.

It has been 3 months since I send them my last article. So, it is okay if I publish those 'pending articles' after 3 months of no reply?

P.S: They published some more articles about corona and quartine related stuffs after they said they had enough content about it.

So, I had applied for a website who were looking for interns. They accepted and provided me 12 weeks of internship( I had to write at least one article everyweek). The first week I write an article and they published it the day after. I was excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, even before the second week ended, I send them second article, but they did not reply. I waited patiently and wrote 2 more articles and send them but they did not reply to my mails. I then went to their facebook page and asked for the review to which they said, Because of Corona Virus pandemic, they are having trouble monitoring the site, and also they have become a different site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 weeks later I did get review, saying my second article will be published soon.However, my third and fourth were rejected as they had enough content on the topic. The third article was on &amp;quot;Things to do in quaratine&amp;quot; where I had listed 10 things to do in quaratine period. &lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"**The Lesson After Two Years of Blogging**

After almost 2 years of blogging, I have learned many great lessons.

I didn't take blogging seriously until June 2019. This was when I had zero knowledge.

I didn't know anything about competition/search engines, so I jumped into blogging in the most competitive niche.

By listening to 'gurus,' I spent an entire year getting almost nowhere.

**That was a huge lesson.**

* 'Gurus' would tell me to build backlinks, so I built the worst backlinks anyone can think of. I didn't understand anything about quality as a newbie. This led me to order a bunch of GSA links - looking back, that was the most idiotic thing any bloggers could do.
* Income School would tell me to focus on content. That gave me hope. At the time, I still didn't fully understand anything about competition. I continued to work towards success. At the time, an article a week seemed like a lot. I was writing slow and struggling with finding the right keywords. I kept pushing out content after content until it was 100,000+ words in one of the toughest niche. I felt lucky enough to get a few visitors from the search engine from each article, but it wasn't anywhere as great.
* YouTube videos would tell me to stick with a niche site, instead of going broad. I focused primarily on finance and digital marketing.

When starting off as a newbie, I was too confident. I thought it was as easy as writing the content and publishing the article, but it wasn't.

**1 Year Later - My Failure**

I learned a lot after a year. I learned why I wasn't getting traffic. I learned from the many mistakes I've made throughout that year.

* Remember when I purchased the links as a newbie? Google penalized my website, so I had to disavow them. I lost 90% of Google traffic.
* For 100,000 words of content, I was getting only 1,600 monthly traffic with $100 in earnings per month from ads. My traffic even going up, but rather down.
* My friends that blogs are beginning to earn 10x to 50x more than I did. It felt like that first website all went to waste. I felt like my time was robbed away from me.

I was stuck, lost, and didn't know what to do. I also know that I can't give up no matter what. I need my life to change and blogging certainly the bus of opportunities that'll give me the life I want.

Years of hard work and failure - I met several bloggers from here that helped me. I'm truly grateful for that.

From advice after advice, I feel like I'm truly ready.

This is the beginning of my new journey - all white hat.

**May 18th, 2020 - The Journey Begins**

On May 18th, 2020, I created my niche website. My friend George (he's a lurker here) helped me with deciding a niche and even ordered a logo for me as a gift. Shoutout to George!

When 1 article a week seemed like a lot to me, the amount of effort [u/PhilReddit7](https://www.reddit.com/u/PhilReddit7/) and [u/shaun-m](https://www.reddit.com/u/shaun-m/) puts into their journey shows a lot. *I was motivated.*

I followed their footsteps, but my content production wasn't nearly as great as them.

Still - I was content and happy. Everything is falling in the right direction.

The more I write, the faster I became. It feels like the puzzle pieces are finally connecting and I know what I'm doing.

**Fast-forward Day 61**

Today, my website's age is 61 days. **Here are the stats:**

* 63,504 words
* 48 articles
* 0 earnings

My organic traffic has started to increase. I've been getting around 3\~10 organic visitors per week. I'm definitely expecting more in a few weeks since my articles from last month are beginning to rank.

Keep in mind that this is a brand new website - not an expired domain.

I honestly feel like I could've done better, so I created some goals.

**Blogging Goals**

* Article count number has to be higher than the days this website has been alive
* Make my first Amazon affiliate sale
* Achieve 100,000 words
* Achieve organic traffic every day for a month

,Blogging,"Hello everyone, this is going to be quite a lengthy post but I would really appreciate any insight or advice that anyone can offer as feeling a bit stuck on the best approach here.

So to first give a bit of background, I have run this site for a number of years now and it’s always held the spot as my main site (and earner), but it’s recently been hit very hard with a combination of the amazon changes (I was in an 8% category), and pretty heavy organic traffic drops.

The site is in a hobby niche and has over 400 articles which mainly target long-tail keywords (a mixture of buying related keywords and informational keywords, though more heavy towards informational).

The site has a DA of 30 and is monetized with Amazon, Display Ads (Mediavine), and also an e-book though it hasn’t been massively successful I haven’t really promoted it outside of the site (probably sold a few hundred copies).

To give some indication of the traffic drops I am talking about, here is a quick snapshot (note: my site is heavily reliant in Organic traffic);

**Prior to the May 5th update, my site was steady between 3500 - 4000 visitors/users per day and would usually spike upwards each weekend.**

**From 6th May it dropped down to 2700 - 3100 visitors/users per day.**

**From 26th May it dropped down to 2500 - 2800 visitors/users per day. From this point, it was holding fairly steady until;**

**From 13th July it dropped again down to 1800 - 2000 visitors/users per day and that's where it's currently sitting.**

So to put it bluntly, the site has been pretty hammered to the tune of -50%, now I have been doing this for a few years now as a side gig so it's not my first experience of Google algorithm updates, but I have never been hit this hard before and really trying to work out the most effective way to try and recover and regain some of my lost traffic. (I have checked Search Console and can confirm, the site has no penalty).

I have pulled reports from Google Analytics so I can which articles/keywords have taken the biggest hit, I did a report comparing June VS May 2020 so I can see the % drops across each article so I have a target list of what articles I need to try and address to hopefully regain traffic but I'm looking for some advice on the best way to go about updating my articles to try and regain lost traffic.

The 2 ideas I have are;

1. Pull the data for each article from Google Search Console to see missing topics/keywords I am ranking for on the bottom of page 1 or 2 and try to include them in the articles by adding more content. (I can paste my article into an excel and use formulas for this to highlight if the term/keywords are in my article).I can also do a manual word count review vs competitors, and to see what topics they are covering that I am missing.
2. Use Surfer SEO to do an analysis of my articles vs top 3 and try surfers suggestions with word count, keywords missing (applying a common-sense approach). My only concern with this is Surfer appears to only analyze 1 specific keyword and where my articles target longtail, I am relying on capturing multiple related and relevant terms that aren't necessarily in the title/h1.

This is obviously going to take some time to do which I am fine with and ready to graft, but I am just want to make sure I am doing this in the most effective way to give me the best chance of seeing results.

I have worked hard on this site for many years and it's a frustrating and demotivating situation that I really want to try and fix.

Has anyone done a mass content update before? How did you go about it? and what worked best for you?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From 6th May it dropped down to 2700 - 3100 visitors/users per day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From 26th May it dropped down to 2500 - 2800 visitors/users per day. From this point, it was holding fairly steady until;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From 13th July it dropped again down to 1800 - 2000 visitors/users per day and that&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s currently sitting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to put it bluntly, the site has been pretty hammered to the tune of -50%, now I have been doing this for a few years now as a side gig so it&amp;#39;s not my first experience of Google algorithm updates, but I have never been hit this hard before and really trying to work out the most effective way to try and recover and regain some of my lost traffic. (I have checked Search Console and can confirm, the site has no penalty).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have pulled reports from Google Analytics so I can which articles/keywords have taken the biggest hit, I did a report comparing June VS May 2020 so I can see the % drops across each article so I have a target list of what articles I need to try and address to hopefully regain traffic but I&amp;#39;m looking for some advice on the best way to go about updating my articles to try and regain lost traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 ideas I have are;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull the data for each article from Google Search Console to see missing topics/keywords I am ranking for on the bottom of page 1 or 2 and try to include them in the articles by adding more content. (I can paste my article into an excel and use formulas for this to highlight if the term/keywords are in my article).I can also do a manual word count review vs competitors, and to see what topics they are covering that I am missing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Surfer SEO to do an analysis of my articles vs top 3 and try surfers suggestions with word count, keywords missing (applying a common-sense approach). My only concern with this is Surfer appears to only analyze 1 specific keyword and where my articles target longtail, I am relying on capturing multiple related and relevant terms that aren&amp;#39;t necessarily in the title/h1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously going to take some time to do which I am fine with and ready to graft, but I am just want to make sure I am doing this in the most effective way to give me the best chance of seeing results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked hard on this site for many years and it&amp;#39;s a frustrating and demotivating situation that I really want to try and fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone done a mass content update before? How did you go about it? and what worked best for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big thanks in advance for any advice here. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"$2,083 from one email campaign. 

These results are nowhere near ""guru-level"", but I'm pretty happy and figured I'd share the strategy with you too.

I've been using my vlog to build an email list for a while, but it works for:

* Bloggers
* Affiliate marketers
* E-comm stores

I've done my best to simplify this, but 'simple' doesn't mean 'easy'.

Now, while anyone can do this, the campaign does need a bit of planning in advance and the number of variables is crazy.

I've broken the campaign down into 3 stages.

There are 3 stages:

* Pre-launch
* Open cart
* Close cart

Prelaunch.... that's all about preparing your list and getting them ready to buy.

Nobody wants to be sold to, so we gotta warm them up a bit first. I send them case study reports a couple of weeks before launch, so they can see the benefits.

Then I countdown to the launch date, one email each day reminding them the product is going on sale.

Open cart... you let them know the product is available. Because anticipation and excitement is high, you'll start seeing sales within minutes of emailing.

You can keep this stage going for as long as you like, but in my experience your sales will diminish over time....

Until....

Close Cart... this is where you tell them you're removing the offer.

If you're an affiliate marketer, you won't be able to remove the offer entirely, so you could remove special bonuses instead.

The point is, the offer needs to change in some way so it creates a sense of urgency.

This is when you'll typically make A LOT of sales.

Now, while only one promotional email is responsible for my revenue, it's built on several pre-launch ones.

And that's the strategy in a nutshell.

But how does this become passive? 

You can automate the entire campaign in an email sequence as part of a funnel. 

That’s what I’m going to do next, because I know it converts. 

I'll also do a follow-up video showing the results of the campaign once I've completed the Open and Close Cart stages if you like.

And if you can't be bothered reading this post, I've made instead (no ads). If allowed I’ll post it in the comments. 

Hope this helps someone out there.

&lt;p&gt;These results are nowhere near &amp;quot;guru-level&amp;quot;, but I&amp;#39;m pretty happy and figured I&amp;#39;d share the strategy with you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been using my vlog to build an email list for a while, but it works for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bloggers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affiliate marketers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-comm stores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done my best to simplify this, but &amp;#39;simple&amp;#39; doesn&amp;#39;t mean &amp;#39;easy&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while anyone can do this, the campaign does need a bit of planning in advance and the number of variables is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve broken the campaign down into 3 stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open cart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close cart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prelaunch.... that&amp;#39;s all about preparing your list and getting them ready to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to be sold to, so we gotta warm them up a bit first. I send them case study reports a couple of weeks before launch, so they can see the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I countdown to the launch date, one email each day reminding them the product is going on sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open cart... you let them know the product is available. Because anticipation and excitement is high, you&amp;#39;ll start seeing sales within minutes of emailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can keep this stage going for as long as you like, but in my experience your sales will diminish over time....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close Cart... this is where you tell them you&amp;#39;re removing the offer.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to start a blog, have bought the domain and the hosting. I was recommended by some people to get the Astra theme, so I bought one for like $50-60 from it's website.. 

When I try to look around the themes it has in built, its very limited like less than a 100. And most of them are for 'Agency' especially all the blog ones.

I don't know how to go about the theme and set up my blog.. and if I had to make a custom self built website then what was the use of purchasing such an expensive theme in the first place... 

I have around 10-12 days left, and I can still get a refund from Astra; later use the free version of Astra and get used to it, or buy another theme that has more one-click-site-build options which I can later customize. Do you guys think thats a good idea?

Hey bloggers, I’m reaching out to ask for your opinions on my startup! - I've listed some questions at the bottom that are my main concerns but any feedback would be appreciated.

**What it is:**

A  way of monetizing your blogs/sites. We offer a paywall which gives  users the choice to view an ad(s) or to pay in micropayments.

**The problem:**

Adblocker is leading to revenue loss

Difficult for small blogs: only payout when you meet a minimum or only can show ads once you have a certain number of visitors

**Our solution:**

Users can pay for access in micropayments (e.g. half a  penny)

Or, users can view ads for free access. Our ads include Captchas so that adblocker will not work for these.

We do not need to aggregate amounts, so you can withdraw earnings straight away.

**The bit you might not like:**

Our service runs on the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Aargh, we know this is off-putting for a lot of people. But hear me out…

**Why we do it this way:**

Bitcoin  Lightning Network has created a way of offering micropayments without  the need of aggregating amounts. It also gives users another level of  privacy (something many are concerned with in this age of privacy and  data rights).

**Why it shouldn’t put you off:**

If you’re interested in cryptocurrency then, great, you can keep it and spend it as you like.

If you want nothing to do with cryptocurrency then that is totally fine. You can convert your money back into your own currency.

**Our driving ambitions are:**

To help content creators get properly rewarded for their work

To give users more control over their online privacy and data

**My questions to you:**

Would  you be more willing to add a paywall to your site that still offered a  means of free access by viewing ads? Or would you be totally against a  hard paywall?

Does the idea of having to deal with cryptocurrency completely turn you off?

If we can make it as simple as possible to set-up, could you get your head around the idea of Bitcoin?

Any other thoughts that you have would be greatly appreciated! The good and the bad.  
You can also drop me an email. I’d love to give you some more information and hear your thoughts: [ruby@satotious.com](mailto:ruby@satotious.com)

,Blogging,"Hi, everyone.

I'm an affiliate marketer who has seen a bit of success and I'm not here to tell you that it's easy unless you are willing to put in the work.

I still make money with Impact Radius from 2 of my affiliate articles ranked #1 on Google. That is where the Impact Radius money comes from.

More so, I make relatively a handful of hundreds of dollars from my blog in local currency. The blog had less than 1,000 visits last month - June, from Search Console.

For this one, I reviewed 1 project and make money off it - ranked Number #2 and #3 for the keyword term.

If you look at my profile you'll see the struggle to outrank my competitors and take the first spot.

Gracefully, this blog has been making at least $100 since May 2020 and it's never crossed 1,200 readers a month.

This is just one of my niche sites.

I have 4 with different strategies but I just got another strategy that can help anyone make $900+ ( I haven't done this yet but I've written a free Case Study and how it was done guide or course of 5,000+ words with definitive images to give to whoever is interested.

&amp;#x200B;

With it, you don't need - SEO, KEYWORDS RESEARCH, TOPICS TO WRITE ON, or even worry about traffic.

The question is if this works then why I'm not doing it? I am quickly saying this to answer some questions I know some good people will ask.

As I said, I have 2 strategies with 4 niches sites. I use the first with the 4 which requires literally no backlinks to rank, geo-location targeting it is... Just 2 is making some money now, mostly the one to be discussed.

And the second strategy is worth even more but I can't focus on it now that's why I am giving it out - for my YouTube subscribers, new visitors, whosoever is interested.

Altogether, I think I have more than 20 free guides and courses I give out, so, if you're doing affiliate marketing and you're not getting traction yet with your blog then you can test this 2nd method and see how it will help you - you're paying for nothing.

You just check it out if it's worth it then you try out if you can make your first income online via blogging. But if you have success already, then you can forgo.

Again: zero backlinks needed, no SEO or optimized articles, no topic research, nothing except writing content around the strategy which you can hire writers.

If interested, I will link the free course to you - again. No email opt-in.

&amp;#x200B;

Away from that. **Let's see how I moved from #6 to the 2nd &amp; 3rd.**

&amp;#x200B;

# From #6 to the 2nd &amp; 3rd.

There was a competitive keyword I targeted. It was, or it is a money keyword.

Since I only bought the domain name in November 2019 and wrote the article the same month, the DA is I think 4... and less than 5.

Over time, I was ranked #6, and I saw that my competitive strength to outrank others was almost impossible.

I had no option than to I hack the process - what is common to savvy SEO guys here on Reddit and the experts you know.

With no traffic as expected, I went to my favorite keyword research tool - I used SEMrush.

I got a lot of long-tail and relative keywords, plus Autosuggests from Google, and also, Related Terms below the page on Google.

&amp;#x200B;

# The action part.

I settled down and wrote optimized content for each subtopic and published it as due.

Over time, the article moved to #5 as I was even ranking first for certain queries - featured Snippet made possible with H2 and H3s.

When I updated and shifted the date of publication to July 2020, the article moved to #4 on ranking.

In my last post, I shared how I lost the snippet which I'm still fighting to get it back - seems Google won't forgive for now. No worries though.

Since ranking on number 4 was like a birthright. I had to do more. Here is what I did.

I built different web 2.0s backlinks to it and used the same targeted keyword to interlink other posts on the site.

&amp;#x200B;

Some Web 2.0s I used - ***Blogger, Medium, WordPress, Pinterest.***

For Pinterest, I pinned different keywords to the same articles. For instance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Top states in the USA**

*New York - Backlinked to the article.*

*Washington - Backlinked to the article.*

*Nevada - Backlinked to the article*

So, I created 3 more sub-articles with a long tail from the main Keyword which helped the more in interlinking.

That's how the result was achieved.

Just to note. I think the number 1 spot is now impossible. Why?

&amp;#x200B;

**It was a branded keyword**

As I checked 2 days ago, I discovered that the brand keyword or parent website - like Clickbank or Amazon built 150,000+ backlinks to the site, and out of no ranking in the 1st-3rd page on Google, moved to the number #1 spot pushing me to 2nd and 3rd.

Well, I am contented with the 2nd and 3rd spot as it relatively brings at least $100 a week if not bad, and if bad $70 with less than 1,000 visits a month.

This for me has helped hone my SEO knowledge since blogging or struggling over 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

# Quick Note

1. Try something out and fail - you'll learn a ton from it based it must be based on what is working.
2. Go for long-tail keywords if the main one is taken, you can still rank #1 for the long tail with featured snippets.
3. Know how to extract keywords (I've got a short video if anyone wants)
4. Updates your articles to current months - Google loves it - as in, updated articles.
5. Build Web 2.0s backlinks if the competition is too much for you.
6. Guest post for higher backlinks if the competition is out of the roof-top or buy backlinks.
7. You don't only need a 5,000, 10k, or 50k visits blog to make your first $100.
8. You can still outrank DA of 30 with a DA site of 4 - but your article must be well optimized.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm glad that these few dollars help gives the motivation to blog and explore more.  With the earnings, I've been able to invest back to the site, buy affiliate programs, and check then out before reviewing to my audiences and more.

Still from this project, I was able to sub for SEMrush and extract a lot of keywords for my 4 niche sites.

I have *free short videos* of how I used them section by section. (Only for anyone interested else other free tools like AlsoAsked, AdWords, Google Planner, UbberSuggest will help for a start.

I hope this helped anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I'm not a guru but I'm open to learning from my seniors here as well. And if you don't know much, you can ask your questions and I will answer you.

*Shout out to Shaun. Another good niche blogger here on Reddit.*

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, if you want the free course, I will leave a free link everyone can download and use... Google Drive will do the work.

*Disclosure: Just want to keep everything clean. If you need the free resources – Course and short videos, then, I will link it to you.  You can comment.*

&amp;#x200B;

To everyone struggling out there. I was there.

Keep on grinding but with the right strategies.

I'm open to image proofs should anyone doubt the process.

1. Keywords that have no data have to be manually updated one by one in order to retrieve their data, thus using your monthly research limits faster.

2. Keywords that haven’t been updated by other users are less competitive.

I wish I had the time to build a case study around this. But I think it might be better to target long-tail (6-7+ word count) question-type keywords that have 0 difficulty after a revealed SERP update.

Hi guys,

I am an ""emerging"" SEO and content marketer. I know my way around WP and pure coding - as pertinent within the context of this question.

I have the following question:

**1) Inputs**

1. I am working with a customer who has the following website - the header contains the following buttons - Home, Blog, Reviews, About.
2. The customer has a pretty narrow niche, but it's lucrative, so he's good :) Let's say it were ""cryptocurrencies"". So, basically, at the home page, he has a review of the ""what crypto is"", 2000 words; in the Blog, he has blog pieces about various things (like - how to use cryptocurrencies as an investment tool, etc.); in the Reviews, he has the reviews of specific cryptocurrencies; and in Contact, he has the contact info.

**2) My suggestion with regard to the strategy on the cornerstone piece**

I suggested that we create the cornerstone piece in the form of ""Cryptocurrencies: Complete Guide"". I want to do the following:

I) ***Do version 1 (deadline - asap)***: Create a 2500 Wiki-styled article on all things cryptocurrenices, provided that: 1) I have the clickable ToC at the top, 2) I make sure that I at least do the following with regard to each concept within the niche: i) create a subheading and write at least 50 words about the concept, ii) or, at least, mention the concept within a relevant passage, 3) Specify all the concepts within the ""Main Concepts Tree"".

II) ***Do version 2 (deadline - within 2 mo)***: The stages:

A. Look up all the concepts in Google and identify those which comply with the following requirements: 1) kinda interesting, 2) have very bad SERP results (I know of 5 such concepts already in the niche!)

B. Range the concepts by 1) attractiveness, 2) quality of SERP

C. Create the stand-alone URL wiki-styled pieces for those which are 1) most attractive, b) have the lowest quality of SERP in order to reap the lowest-hanging fruit, provided that I heavely uplink and downlink and crosslink.

D. Continue creating the pieces till the ""Main Concepts Tree"" has been covered.

**3) The problem with the cornerstone piece placement**

So, I have the following problem:

1. I don't understand where the piece should go - whether I should create a stand-alone section and call it either ""Niche FAQ"", ""Niche Wiki"", ""Complete Guide"", ""Glossary"" or something like that, or whether it should go into the blog section.
2. If I decide to create the stand-alone section and if we decide to move on with writing out the ""Main Concepts Tree"" over the next 3 months, this would result in the following:

* a. the inner articles would be kinda-sorta blog posts, but not exactly.
* b. the customer currently has a pretty weak blog with just a few blog posts which talk not about any specific keywords (i.e. the team isn't trying to capture the warming leads via providing useful content throughout the lead's buying journey, but they are just ""writing a blog"").
* c. If we decide to move along with the stand-alone section, I would need to rationalize the need to have the two sections - the Wiki one and the Blog one. And, honestly, I don't like teams who ""blog for the sake of blogging"". Those articles never pull in any traffic. And the customer would be much-much better off with using the keyword-focused blog posts.
* d. But - here's my main problem, I guess - in this day and age, I personally have a very bad opinion on ""internal corporate blogs"" because in 90% of cases they suck big time. So, creating a completely stand-alone section seems like a much better idea. I've been researching this niche for a few days, and I am seeing that 100% of players in this niche have very bad blogs, without any strategy or desire to actually help folks understand their niche. So, ""differentiating"" the Wiki Section from the ""standard blogs at competitors"" might be a very strong strategy. Otherwise, leads just wouldn't care to give us a try, but we are going to create a highly useful section, without any fluff. We also plan to specify the ""Wiki, Guide"" or something like that in the meta title and description in order to ""signal"" to the searcher that this Section is completely different from the standard blogs at the competitors.

Thanks in advance for any responses.",t2_3bgq47az,False,,0,False,Should I create another Section or Just a blog post for the cornerstone piece?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Question'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Question,0,,False,t3_hrv4pj,False,dark,0.75,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1594872882.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"Hey guys, I am seeking some advice on which domain names will optimize my SEO. I posted a few days ago and got some advice on TLDs but I realized my blog covers a topic that is spelled differently depending on where you are from. I found some alt TLDs with the UK/Canadian spelling but not the American spelling and now I'm considering three options. The target audience of the blog is universal so my question is **which of my two options would you think is best for optimizing SEO?**

For example, if my blog was called something like the flavour academy (uk spelling) which of the following options do you think would do better for SEO?

* 1 A. Get the UK spelling of a .co domain (.com is too pricy). Does the different spelling of Flavor vs Flavour affect SEO results?
* 1 B. Get both and re-direct the US to the main website such as: [Flavouracademy.co](https://Flavouracademy.co) and/or [Flavoracademy.co](https://Flavoracademy.co)
* 2. Get an alternative TLD that fits with the branding such as [Flavour.Academy](https://Flavour.Academy) or [Flavour.blog](https://Flavour.blog) do you think these alternative TLDs hurt or help SEO?

I posted a few days ago and got some advice on TLDs but I realized my blog covers a topic that is spelled differently depending on where you are from. I found some alt TLDs with the UK/Canadian spelling but not the American spelling and now I&amp;#39;m considering three options. The target audience of the blog is universal so my question is &lt;strong&gt;which of my two options would you think is best for optimizing SEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if my blog was called something like the flavour academy (uk spelling) which of the following options do you think would do better for SEO?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 A. Get the UK spelling of a .co domain (.com is too pricy). Does the different spelling of Flavor vs Flavour affect SEO results?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 B. Get both and re-direct the US to the main website such as: &lt;a href=""https://Flavouracademy.co""&gt;Flavouracademy.co&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=""https://Flavoracademy.co""&gt;Flavoracademy.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2. Get an alternative TLD that fits with the branding such as &lt;a href=""https://Flavour.Academy""&gt;Flavour.Academy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""https://Flavour.blog""&gt;Flavour.blog&lt;/a&gt; do you think these alternative TLDs hurt or help SEO? I know google says they make no difference so I guess its more of a question of if people will actively search for  &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;academy&amp;quot; when searching for things my blog covers?&lt;/li&gt;

I'll start off by saying that I'm not sure if this is even the right subreddit to be posting in, so I sincerely apologize if that's the case.

Having said that, I'll be straightforward with you all.

I researched other ways of adding to this revenue of which I came across affiliate marketing and brand partnerships.

And I’m ok with being downvoted to oblivion.

This shit is hard. 

You’re going to fail sometimes, the point is to get back up, a little wiser. So you gotta fail fast. 

I know this because I’ve been there too. 

And I’ve failed more than most. 

I’ve also had a few wins. 

My current Youtube channel has just reached 10,000 subscribers in the most competitive niche. That’s a small win. 

But still... my very first site (in a different niche)... became an authority but only because I worked my ass off between 2004 to 2007 to make it happen. 

And ya know what?

That site barely provided me with a living... until someone a lot smarter than me pointed me in the right direction. 

So the truth is it’s going to take you months and months of solid work to get anywhere... and the more value you deliver to your market, the faster you’ll begin to see success. 

Your niche is important, but practically all of them are saturated now. 

If you’re worried about that, don’t let it put you off. 

Saturated niches are ok.

But you wanna avoid are niches where there’s no competition. That’s a bad sign. 

So look for competition. 

And it’s ok to enter saturated niches but you gotta slice it in half. And then half it again.

So instead of going into something like ‘weight loss’, go for ‘weight loss for men’...

But oh shit the competition is still massive... so you go ‘weight loss for men over 40’.

You dig?

It’s a fuckton easier to establish yourself as an authority as “the dude who helps middle aged men to lose weight” than the “dude who helps everyone lose weight”.

It took me years and years of failing to figure this out.

&lt;p&gt;A) Include a link on the top of my menu bar for that specific band, which would navigate them to posts about that band, which are hosted in their own tag? This would probably be the simplest, though it’d leave out posts that are related but not tagged (i.e. about a member’s solo activities, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B) Include a link on the top of my menu bar for that specific band, which would navigate them to posts about that band, which are hosted in their own category of “band + related”? I’m in the process of setting up categories for that right now, as I’ve written a LOT of posts about that band. I’m planning on option B right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C) Include a link on the top of my menu bar for that specific band, which would navigate them to posts about that band, which are hosted in their own page of “band + related”? This would be the most labor-intensive, but would also allow me to curate the experience somewhat, listing posts by type, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D) Do nothing and allow people to just find stuff on their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E) None of the above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love advice. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"Hi all

Thought I'd  share my thoughts over the past 6 months of blogging and some of what's ""worked"" and what hasn't worked. When I say something ""worked"" it means something was successful at helping me enjoy blogging and/or get the right type of attention.

When I first started blogging my goal was to get 10 or so unique views a day. That was a very superficial goal but I think I do need some attention in order to justify doing this. At the moment I am getting about 20-30 views a day with 50 or so subscribers.

**What's worked:**

1. Moderating my expectations and learning to enjoy the process of blogging independent on any attention
2. Talking to people in this community &amp; other bloggers
3. The stuff I didn't expect - I have found that some of my posts rank for key words completely unintentionally
4. Guest posting on similar sites and reaching out to well known bloggers in my space
5. Simplifying the blog as much as possible to avoid it becoming a time sink
6. Not forcing a post idea - the thoughts should come naturally from what I experience in day to day life
7. Learning about specialized topics e.g. what makes a great title
8. Avoiding doing clickbaitey things - I find being clickbaitey compromises authenticity and makes me dislike my own work

&amp;#x200B;

**What hasn't worked:**

1. Seeking artificial attention e.g. by posting content on forums relevant to my niche - its usually just 1 click and not the right type of attention
2. Twitter - I find it very frustrating and superficial and absorbs a lot of mental energy. Then again I am not very good at it.
3. Checking views each day and keeping track of what's happening

,Blogging,"Hello everyone,

So, normally I only share the experiences that I think could help other people, but today I want a little help from you guys.

Before I begin, I want to let you know that I'm a content writer for the past three years. I live in India and I have been working for Indian clients for the most part in this three year period. Only recently, I started working for international clients because yeah, you guessed it, even the entry-level pay is much higher compared to the Indian market of freelancers. I won't get into the debate of if we are damaging the market or anything because I have other concerns. 

So, I have always tried to improve my writing skills in terms of writing like a native speaker, but recently, I wrote a sample newsletter for a client and she said that although my grammar is fine, it sounds like a non-native speaker wrote it.

Now, I know there are a lot of factors that come into play but I don't wanna know if she is wrong or right. I don't wanna know if I'm right or not. All I want to know is the difference in the writing of native speakers and non-native speakers. Also, I'm not saying that my writing looks like a native speaker wrote it, I know I sound like a non-native speaker, but I just can't seem to figure out the deciding factor between the two.

She said that I'm not the kind of writer she is looking for and said that she would pay for that sample but won't continue work with me. I refused to accept the payment for two reasons. First, if she is not going to use my content, then there is no point in charging her. Secondly, I wanted you guys to take a look at this and point out what really shows that I'm a non-native speaker.

&gt;Are you feeling frustrated that even after applying for hundreds of job interviews, you still aren't getting any response? Are you starting to doubt your abilities and skills? Well, let us assure you one thing, there is nothing wrong with you, and you are not any less qualified if not more than the thousands of other candidates applying for the same job. Then, what is it that is stopping you? Yeah, you guessed it, it's your resume, and it makes sense if you think about it. Any hiring manager has to go through thousands of resumes every day, but they don't have the time to read through each and every candidate's resume. So, what is the chances of you landing an interview is, considering your average resume among the other thousand candidates? Very low, and this is where a professional resume writing service like us come into play.  
&gt;  
&gt;We make sure that your resume shows off all your skills, qualifications, achievements, and experiences in the most effective way possible. How do we do it? By showing off only the key achievements and qualifications of your career that are actually relevant to the job role. However, this is not what makes the resume more impactful. It is the use of numbers and detailed metrics to show off these achievements that makes it more impactful.  
&gt;  
&gt;But this is not enough. We now have to make sure that your resume can engage and capture the reader's attention at the very first glance. To achieve this goal, firstly, we do the basics, like keeping the resume in only a single page and keeping it in a PDF format. Then we make sure the text font is plain and simple for easy readability. After that comes the more subtle improvements in a resume that makes the most significant differences, like the use of industry-related keywords and a good structure.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a professional resume writing service provider, we have the knowledge and experience to know what works and what doesn't, and this confidence and quality curated from years of experience and wisdom show itself in the resume, which is what makes all the difference in the world.

I have a blog in entertainment niche.

(Fairly in top 5)

So, what am thinking right now is to invest in Expired Tumblrs.

Enquired about a few on Fiverr and  Avg Tumblr PA the guy is offering me is 20ish with unique IPs

My real question here is, are expired Tumblrs worth a shot to see a little bit of increase in Ranking (say from 5th position to 2nd or 3rd) or are Tumblr way too old school and outdated?

I came up with this idea because I felt there was a gap in the market, I’ve decided to give it a go as a hobby while I am off work on furlough and to improve my writing skills.

I’m going to try to ask friends for general questions to get started (and maybe try online on reddit!) so I can create content.

I passionately want to help people with similar issues, and make a living doing so. I have realistic expectations of how this works, and my long term goal is maybe $150-200/day. That amount for life is enough to live on with things here and there for enjoyment. Anything extra is gravy.

So, I have been doing a lot of research on how to build a blog based on substance abuse and its relations to mental illness. Primarily ADHD, since thats affected my life immensely. I have a Human Bio B.S. degree and a metric butt-ton of knowledge on these subjects, a lot from experiences, my own obsessive, never ending research, my ability to incorporate the research into my knowledge of the human body biologically, as well as my counseling and therapy sessions (which are free resources themselves lol). I think its specific enough, in the sense that Im taking 2 huge topics and narrowing them down by specifically combining them which will be the focus, but Im not exactly a therapist, or have a mental health degree/career (aside from a year of working with disabled people). Im confident in my knowledge, but what would I be marketing? Theres not too much affilate marketing it seems, and the big thing with this is making a course, or digital products, maybe my own services? But what would that be thats not going to be in the blog?

Let me clarify a bit, I really want to help people who are struggling with substance abuse and mental illness, its definitely a passion, but I do want to set it up as a business as well. A lot of people might have just come to a diagnosis, and are looking for help. Myself, I wasnt diagnosed until about 7 months ago with ADHD–PI, and Im 27, mainly because I made it through high school/college, albeit on my own schedule and not really adhering to normal uhhhhhhhhh methods. I do this with work as well, having my own schedule is very ideal, i work well on my own routine, as it can fluctuate due to ADHD.

I can help people with coping mechanisms, how to avoid relapse, partly by keeping a mental illness under control, how to cope with the fact that a mental illness may have caused this downward life spiral. What to do what theyre feeding off of each other. Where to get help. How to help yourself. Why it causes addiction (for ADHD, low dopamine, hyperfocusing, thrill seeking, ordinary life is dull), lifestyle changes that help, Etc etc. 

Im EXTREMELY in tune with how they biologically work (college degree helped with something I guess), and my coping mechanisms and strats are things Im actively working on, and I will be transparent about that, especially if I talk about addiction + anything else, depression and anxiety for example.

I know there are a lot of people interested. One example, I posted a colorful image describing the differences between the types of ADHD, as well as couple captions from a popular adult ADHD book (Driven to Distraction – Ned Hallowell), which included symptoms that arent very well known publically, as in not a part of the stereotype. This was posted on Imgur, solely for a reddit private chat. Not meant for the public lol. All of a sudden, its at 5k likes on Imgur and hundreds of comments of “do I have ADHD” “that sounds like me omg” “me/my loved on has ADHD and this has opened my eyes to how they work” “Im not a lazy fuck after all” ""these are cool, but how do I deal with these symptoms"" ""these symptoms sound like a horoscope (my favorite one 😑)"" etc.

This is solely ADHD. Addiction is maybe a bigger pain point, because of how rapidly it throws your life into complete chaos, and its very noticable. No need for a diagnosis, you know if youre an addict.

The people are there. The help is wanted, from those affected and their loved ones. So how do I do it, and make my own living from it? Products are like, books, fidget toys, weighted blankets lol. And idk what to do for digital products, that maximize helping people, and my income. I dont want to make shit products, I really am passionate about giving that value and helping peoples lives.

,Blogging,"Hey Bloggers,

I've been posting case study updates for a site I started in Jan over in the juststart subreddit. The most common questions I get are:

\- How am I doing my keyword research? ([I answered that in this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/gssvpf/my_keyword_research_strat_i_used_to_go_from_050k/)), and

\- How am I doing my on-page optimization (which I'm answering in this post).

For some overview, here is how my site has grown in the first 6 months of its life:

|Mth|\# articles|\# pageviews|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Jan|31|109|
|Feb|70|677|
|Mar|86|6,533|
|Apr|33|30,001|
|May|35|48,275|
|June|22|42,748|
|**Totals**|**277**|**128,343**|

[I published a post on my blog with more screenshots and stuff you can see here](https://earningfinancialfreedom.com/how-i-write-longtail-low-comp-blog-posts-that-rank-on-page-1/).

I can outline my process for you here though.

It's nothing mindblowing, there are no real secrets, but you might find a couple of small nuances that help you improve your on-page SEO, and sometimes it just takes one or two little things.

Anyhow, almost all of my posts follow this format (allowing for some flexibility as no two keywords/posts are identical):

**URL/Header** \- this is the keyword

**Intro** \- this is your best chance to get a snippet (unless you need a list, but for the keywords I go after it never has been)

**Subheaders** \- I follow the usual format of 2-4 H2s with some content to build out the post

**Images** \- I add two, sometimes three images per post with alt tags

**Summary** \- adding a summary gives you a second chance to get a snippet, I know I've nailed quite a few from adding this H2 section

# Some key things about how I write that might differ from you

* I keep it natural, I really do. I don't keyword stuff, or even add the keyword at all for a lot of posts if it doesn't fall into the article.
* I give a complete answer to keywords that are questions as the first paragraph in my post. I don't care about people reading further on or not.
* I don't add fluff, my posts are what most people call ""short"" 600-800 words because that's enough to answer the question.
* I don't care what Yoast has to say (I don't use it), that plugin does more harm than good in my opinion.

# How can this help you?

I always see people posting here that they want more traffic. This is one way you can get more traffic to your site.

It won't cost you anything either, unless you outsource content.

The growth of my site is nothing special, I've grown sites faster before, and I've had similar success across all kinds of niches.

If you target the right keywords and write a post with good on page SEO you'll rank. You will. It's hard not to.

For the whiners that always seem to find something to complain about;

* I'm not selling anything.
* I'm not promoting anything.
* I'm not saying my way is better than another way.
* You don't have to optimize your content how I do.

I'm just showing you guys what I do and how I do it with screenshots to back up my results.

I enjoy helping other people and know this is going to help some of you that can't increase your traffic.

The day after I posted, I had my all-time high view count and the dopamine rush that hit me was indescribable. For those of you who haven't seen my previous post, I will like to introduce myself and share with you some of my goals.

**About me and my goals:**

I'm currently still a student so I do not expect to make a full-time income off this blog. I am taking this as a learning experience so that in the future, I will be able to do this better. Currently, I do not have plans on monetizing my blog but if I gain enough traction, I may look into it. My goal is to have about 1000 page views per month by the end of a year.

I've decided to start this series of posts to share my experience in trying to grow my own blog from scratch with no prior experience. I hope that I can offer some insights along the way and inspire those who are looking to do the same as well. I want to make mistakes along the way so that I can learn from it and share it with all of you so that you too can learn from it.

**What I've done thus far:**

Since my previous post, I've worked on a few things to improve my blog.

* I've added a mailing list service. ([MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/))
* I tried to do keyword research before writing my new posts. However, I have some doubts regarding this which I will go into later.
* I've improved my Instagram feed to look more visually pleasing and attract more traffic.
* I added a Linktree in the bio of my Instagram to include more links to my posts.

**The site's traffic thus far:**

Between setting up the blog on 7th April 2020 to 3 months later, 7th July 2020, the site's statistics are as follow:

* 158 unique sessions
* 540 page views
* 88% new visitors and 12% returning visitors

**Some doubts I have:**

* Many of you kindly advised me to do some keyword research for my posts. I use [Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/) for my keyword research. However, I am a bit unclear about this. Do I target keywords that are high in volume to have higher traffic or do target low-volume keywords for lower competition? So far I've been targetting keywords that have a low score in SEO difficulty.
* There have been many posts here advocating on the effectiveness of Pinterest in bringing traffic to your site. I've posted on Pinterest but for some reason, I cannot see the insights on my Pinterest posts. Anyone can offer some insight on this?
* I've been thinking of being more active on subreddits like [r/SGExams](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams) since it is relevant to my content and I can bring traffic by leaving comments that value-add. Anyone can offer insights on using Reddit as a platform for attracting traffic?

**Some fun things I would like to share:**

* I tried something new and posted a carousel on my Instagram page. I designed some graphics and offered a sneak peek to my post along with some information.

,Blogging,"Just as you, I have also come across various Reddit posts of freelancers asking the same question, ""how to get clients?"", and every time other freelancers' answers are ""look for clients in job boards, LinkedIn, referrals, and COLD PITCH."" People who are in this industry for a long time understands how powerful cold pitching actually is. So, they always recommend doing cold pitching, as from their perspective, it's the most effective method to get clients. However, I have noticed that most of the beginners or the people asking such questions don't know the exact steps to cold pitch, which is completely okay. Even I didn't have any idea when I first started cold pitching, but as time passed, I kinda figured it out myself. 

Now, I'm not saying that the method I'm about to show you on cold pitching is the only and most effective method out there. Part of the reason, I'm sharing my approach to cold pitching is because I want to start a conversation where everyone shares their experiences, knowledge, and methods of cold pitching. 

**The Pitch**

I want you to read this section one more time after you finish reading the entire post. The pitch is the most important factor for your success. How to create the perfect pitch? Well, here are some key features of a perfect pitch, in my opinion -

* Do not sell your services in the first email. The only purpose of your pitch is to start a conversation, not to get them as your client.
* Lead with value. You must have heard this before, but what does it mean? You will understand how to lead with value in each of the methods after you read them and use this simple formula - Find something your potential client is doing wrong or can do better, tell them in a friendly way on how they can do it better (do not keep anything to yourself, actually give them a solution that does not require your services as all)
* At the end of your pitch, let them know that you are available to help further if they have any other doubts. Even better, I leave a cliffhanger at the end of my emails that prompt them to reply. It doesn't work every time, but it surely increases my chances of getting a reply. Get creative and find out how you can create your own cliffhanger relevant to each of the following methods.
* Apart from these key factors, I know that there are other factors as well that come into play. I want you guys to share them with others in the comments. It really helps to know different people's opinion on something. 

**Find websites with trash content on their blog section**

There is nothing fancy about this method. You just find a few websites that have bad or really bad content on their blog section, you email them with your pitch, and you do this every day until you finally find a client. Now, there are some nuances to this method that I feel are very important to know to succeed. 

Firstly, how and where do you find these websites and blogs? I'm sure there are countless ways to go about it, but I'm gonna share what I used to do. 

Go to Google, type your niche + blogs, and search. Now, most of the time you may wanna ignore the first page of that Google search because if a page made it to the first page of Google then it probably has very good quality content (not every time though). Go to the second, third, fourth, fifth page of Google searches, go to every website, every blog. Continue to do this until you find some websites or blogs with trash content, email them with your cold pitch, then do this with a few other niches as well.  

**Approach businesses that are trying to create an online presence but are not investing in blogs**

Let's get straight to the ""how"" part. Look for new business on Google on different niches. There are some softwares (paid) that show you all the business websites in any particular niche of any particular city. You'll get hundreds of results. Go through each website, pick out the ones that are trying to create an online presence but are not investing in blog content. But how to find that out? Well, go through their social media platforms, see if they are running ads, see if they are regularly making changes to their website, see if they have a Facebook pixel installed on their website, etc. Now, after doing this analysis, you will find two kinds of websites. The first kind is the ones whose owner doesn't give a crap about their website or creating a strong online presence. I mostly ignore these kinds of websites and businesses, I'll tell you why in a minute. The second kind of businesses and websites that you'll find will be the one who, as I said are trying to create an online presence but are not investing in blogs. These people are easy to explain to, the importance of blogging because they already understand the importance of digital presence for their business compared to the first kind of business owners. Since convincing them to invest in blogging will be much harder since you'll first have to explain to them, the importance of digital marketing.

**Social Media** 

Find out social media accounts that are creating content for any particular niche. Most of the time, they'll have a website with no blog section. If you find such pages, DM them, explain to them how blogging can help their website. Basically, the same as the previous method, the only difference is you are approaching social media pages instead of websites. I like to use Instagram for this particular method, as a lot of small startups or soloprenuer are trying to create a community. Although, you can do this on YouTube as well. Check out for YouTube channels that have a somewhat decent following but no website or blog. Tell them how blogging about the same topic they have covered in YouTube videos can help them to double their audiences by reaching people through different mediums. Get creative and do this on every social media platform(if possible). 

**The Most Important Step**

These are only three ways of cold pitching. I'm sure there are countless other methods, but to succeed in getting a client through cold pitching, the key is not to do all of them. The key is to follow a single method or a number of selective methods (if you are not busy) that you think you are good at, and then putting in the work and every single day. I know it sounds very corny, but consistency and persistence are truly the key to success here. You will feel like nothing is working, I used to think that as well, but keep in mind that you WILL see results if you stick to the process. I commit to myself that I will stick to a method for more than two months. This way if I ever feel like nothing is working, I just remind myself that it's only been a week, or two, and I have to do this for another month and a half.

,Blogging," Hi Guys,

I'm finally starting my venture to blogging related to life, travel and the people I meet along the way. The core purpose of the blog will not be to earn money at this point, but to talk about things that might get people interested in the blog.

I then later (after a year or more) intend to use the same blog to do affiliate marketing and possibly Adsense, to make some $.

However, there's some questions that are making me unsure.

Firstly, I wanted to ask, if my niche and approach to blogging is good, or not? And if you guys have any recommendations.

Secondly, I have to choose a domain name.. Do you guys have any recommendations about the domain and hosting I should take as a complete beginner? I was considering Hostgator's Hatchling plan. Also I was thinking of something like 'wasifwrites' (my name), 'cometravelwithme', 'letsbemindful', 'mylifeinmywords', 'letsgoexplore', 'placesandme', etc as my domain name options. Can you guys help me decide on one, or maybe recommend another considering my niche?

Other than the questions I asked, knowledge and recommendations about anything related to blogging, get more views, SEO, blogging-tools, etc would be highly appreciated as well.

**Previous Updates**

[May 2020](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/gyauo1/growing_a_blog_network_to_25000_a_month_may_2020/)

Just a few points to quickly cover from FAQs from last month's update. I don't give out any of the actual URLs for my affiliate blogs as it is too easy to use a tool like AHRefs to scan them and duplicate the more profitable keywords with your own articles on your own sites. I had a number of people reaching out last month as they wanted to see what my affiliate blogs look like but I go over examples of how I format my affiliate and display ad articles in [this video](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/ekeo43/how_i_format_my_articles_with_affiliate_and/) and little to nothing has changed in the layout of my articles since publishing that.

I also had a few people reaching out and asking what my daily workflow looks like as an affiliate blogger and [this a day in the life video](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/gkkdvr/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_3500_per_month_affiliate/) pretty much covers it. I am still in the scaling phase for my blogs so doing a large amount of the work myself while outsourcing various tasks where possible too. I also had a bunch of people reaching out and asking how they could get started with affiliate blogging and [I published this Quora answer](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/hlocyh/3844_word_quora_answer_whats_the_easiest_way_to/) to a similar question over the weekend that's almost 4000 words that may be helpful.

***Generation One Domains***

My generation one domains use a keyword research method that is not as efficient as it once was due to the 4th May 2020 Google update to their algorithm. Additionally, many of these first-generation domains were tests to transition from old school automated black hat SEO to a more Google-friendly method of off-page SEO.

**Domain 1 - $164**

\- [Income](https://i.imgur.com/3D3PhY5.png)

\- [Wordcount](https://i.imgur.com/WEQeL3S.png)

Nothing has changed for this domain since the May 2020 update due to it having been hit by the Google Media algorithm update as well as being in a niche where the April 2020 Amazon Affiliate commission cuts reduced its income by around 60%. I don't plan to work on this domain anymore due to this and I haven't added a new article to it since early 2018 if I remember correctly. I am happy with it ticking over bringing in $164 a month from now on as the domain has been profitable for a while now. It's just a shame that just as its traffic starts to pick up, Amazon decide to cut their commission rates for its niche else I think this domain would be &gt;$500 per month now.

Similar to domain 1 covered above, nothing has changed for this domain since the May 2020 update and I haven't published a new article to the domain since September 2019. It has also been hit negatively by two Google updates but thankfully the Google update in November 2019 recovered it from the negative updates and it's now doing better than ever. I put a video up on [what to expect for your first six months of blogging](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/h9proe/what_to_expect_for_the_first_six_months_of/) featuring this domain as I feel that it is likley the best example that I have from my current portfolio for anyone wanting to get started with affiliate blogging.

\- [Dedicated Site Report Video](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/fmks0a/site_report_four_earning_around_1200_a_month/)

Although I have not actually published any new content on this domain in the month of June, I have been researching some new products that have been confirmed for the niche. The regular teaser videos are on YouTube with photos on the brands social media accounts but there is no real information on the specs, price, or release date for the items. Out of the three, I think two will be really good and popular within the niche so once I have more info I will be putting out more content for them but the third item seems to be a more expensive version of one of their current items so not sure how that one will do.

The community based around this particular niche has been putting out a bunch of speculation regarding price, specs, and release date but I can't find anything solid from the actual brand. As we are already a week into July I doubt they will be released this month now but time will tell. Even if the brand releasing these products would just confirm the specs and price I can start knocking out the bare bones of some articles with the correct information but until then I will just focus on growing my newer domains.

I have noticed a compeating domain in this niche that seems to have used a tool like AHRefs to scan my domain and pull the keywords that it is ranking in Google for. The new compeating domain is only publishing articles targeting keywords that my domain is already ranking in the top three of Google for but their on-page SEO is not as good as mine and from what I can tell, they are not doing any off-page SEO either.

Right now I am not taking this compeating domain as a threat but if they do start to build backlinks to their content and fix the on-page SEO issues they are having I may have to spend some cash on this domain to get it stronger backlinks so it can keep ranking for the terms it is pulling traffic for.

This domain is the one I started in January 2020 and it surprisingly saw some really solid growth in both traffic and income considering the problems it is having. Essentially, there is an issue with the Google indexing system right now that they have confirmed they are aware of but seem to be struggling to fix. They [tweeted out](https://i.imgur.com/XJJqcIA.png) at the start of June that they had fixed the issue but the comments on the twitter post and my own experience contradict this with some people on twitter saying that the ""fix"" actually made it worse for their domain.

[This is a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/fGfkNrO.png) of this domains coverage tab from my Google Search Console and as you can see from the verticle bars, there was a dip in the pages that were excluded from the Google Index when I used the force index option in Search Console but Google kicked the pages backout of their index a few days later again. It's a shame because I have a bunch of keywords ready to go for this domain but I don't want to put the time and effort into publishing them only for them to not get indexed in Google and not be able to pull traffic and make money so I will be waiting until Google fix the issue.

I have had a bunch of people reaching out about this issue and how to fix it but it does just seem to be a gamble right now. Force indexing in Google Search Console fixed this issue for this domain for around a week before Google kicked the articles out of their index, for Domain 5 I used the exact same force indexing system and it fixed the issue for the domain. I'm just hoping that Google can work out what's actually wrong and fix it asap.

This is the domain that I launched on 1st May 2020 only for Google to release their 4th May 2020 update and make the keywords that I was targeting on the domain much higher competition. For this niche the Google update seems to have given sites like YouTube, Reddit, Quora, and Amazon much more weight in the SERPs and pushed them really high on page one. Although Domain 3 was also hit by this update dropping by around 20% in traffic (starting to see some recovery now), that niche was not hit anywhere near as badly as this one and I can definitely see how some people were reporting &gt;80% traffic drops back in May for their blogs after taking a more in-depth look of how the update affected this niche.

All of the keyword research for this domain that was done in April is pretty much useless now due to the update. That said though, I have spend some time using my post 4th May update keyword research method to try and find keywords to grow this domain in the future once I am done with Domain 6. Although I have been able to find around 50, it is much harder to do in this niche now due to the way the May 4th update hit it.

I keep flip-flopping between trying to find more keywords to get it up to 10,000 monthly sessions so I can get it on Ezoic or Monumetric for the higher display ad income or just scrapping it and letting it die and going with a new niche for my display ad project. I am kind of using keyword research for this project as a way to break up the monotony for churning out the articles for Domain 6 though. I basically smash out an article for Domain 6 and then take a little break doing keyword research for this domain so I will see how many actionable keywords I have by the time Domain 6 is finished and I need something new to focus on content-wise.

One of my friends who is more experienced with informational intent keywords for display ad sites has a theory that this may just be an extension to [the Google Sandbox effect](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/gus2bt/my_experience_with_the_google_sandbox/) for some niches/keyword combos. He is having the same issue with his latest domain and has sunk much more cash into his project than I have for mine. I'm not sure if this will pan out but there's not really anything else to do with the keywords already published on the domain than wait and see if it does pick up at the &gt;6 months of age mark or not.

**Generation Two Domains**

My second generation domains are build using a keyword research method that I am developing after the 4th May 2020 Google update that affected the way I did keyword research for my first-generation affiliate domains above. These domains are also based around being smaller niche sites rather than large multi-niche sites so if a competitor does scan my domains with a tool such as AHRefs, they only get a small portion of the keywords for my full money site network.

**Domain 6**

\- [Wordcount](https://i.imgur.com/8OD0WZ2.png)

This domain has been my main focus for July and it was launched around the 1st June with the Wordcount count above. I have freelance writers helping me with the content for this domain and they are focusing on the longer buyer guide type posts for higher search volume/higher competition keywords while I am focusing on trying to knock out 50 articles using the [zero search volume strategy](https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/gx0biz/using_zero_search_volume_keywords_to_your/) that I have been playing with over the years.

The keywords that my freelance writers are working on are essentially a proof of concept for a theory I have for keyword research after the Google 4th May update and if it works then I will move forward with that method for my affiliate sites. The articles that I am focusing on are based around the latest version of the zero search volume strategy on the theory that as keyword tools usually say the keyword gets zero searches, most people ignore it and they tend to be lower competition and much easier to rank for.

From the test batches of these keywords that I have been putting on my older domains, these keywords do tend to get traffic, usually, around &gt;50 hits per month but they don't require backlinking to actually rank in Google. Although 50 hits per month is not much, the last round of this strategy that I tried on domain 3 are running at around $100 per 1000 hits to the domain so with the right item price point, 20 of these articles can potentially bring in $100 a month and they are usually 1000-1500 words rather than 2000-4000 words too. Although its slightly different, Phil who runs [this case study](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/hjjfba/ad_revenuecontent_site_case_study_mth6/) has confirmed that he uses a similar keyword research method and has managed to have his second &gt;$500 month on a domain that is only six months old.

If this test batch of the zero search volume keywords works then I am actually considering making domain 7 based around nothing but these keywords with zero backlinks to it too as it can be another way to scale. As the method can be used for both affiliate and display ad keywords, I might try to use the method to try find keywords for Domain 5 too but as its a display ad site, the RPM might be too low to make it worth it.",t2_ygjlv,False,,1,False,"Growing A Blog Network To &gt;$25,000 A Month! - June 2020 - $4744/$25,000.","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tips/Info'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Tipsinfo,0,,False,t3_hms93c,False,dark,0.95,,public,56,1,{},2c8899b2-4b29-11e8-894b-0ea72814b416,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Info,False,56,,False,,False,flair,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'https://www.youtube.com/ShaunMarrs'}]",{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1594147515.0,richtext,6,,,richtext,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is my second monthly update post for Reddit and it is essentially a text-based version of my &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/hk0lpp/4813_earned_online_blogging_income_report_for/""&gt;monthly update video&lt;/a&gt; that I post too.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generation One Domains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My generation one domains use a keyword research method that is not as efficient as it once was due to the 4th May 2020 Google update to their algorithm. Additionally, many of these first-generation domains were tests to transition from old school automated black hat SEO to a more Google-friendly method of off-page SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain 1 - $164&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/2mzhJNL.png""&gt;Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/WEQeL3S.png""&gt;Wordcount&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing has changed for this domain since the May 2020 update due to it having been hit by the Google Media algorithm update as well as being in a niche where the April 2020 Amazon Affiliate commission cuts reduced its income by around 60%. I don&amp;#39;t plan to work on this domain anymore due to this and I haven&amp;#39;t added a new article to it since early 2018 if I remember correctly. I am happy with it ticking over bringing in $164 a month from now on as the domain has been profitable for a while now. It&amp;#39;s just a shame that just as its traffic starts to pick up, Amazon decide to cut their commission rates for its niche else I think this domain would be &amp;gt;$500 per month now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain 2 - $1179&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ViiYFUr.png""&gt;Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to domain 1 covered above, nothing has changed for this domain since the May 2020 update and I haven&amp;#39;t published a new article to the domain since September 2019. It has also been hit negatively by two Google updates but thankfully the Google update in November 2019 recovered it from the negative updates and it&amp;#39;s now doing better than ever. I put a video up on &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/h9proe/what_to_expect_for_the_first_six_months_of/""&gt;what to expect for your first six months of blogging&lt;/a&gt; featuring this domain as I feel that it is likley the best example that I have from my current portfolio for anyone wanting to get started with affiliate blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain 3 - $1952&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have not actually published any new content on this domain in the month of June, I have been researching some new products that have been confirmed for the niche. The regular teaser videos are on YouTube with photos on the brands social media accounts but there is no real information on the specs, price, or release date for the items. Out of the three, I think two will be really good and popular within the niche so once I have more info I will be putting out more content for them but the third item seems to be a more expensive version of one of their current items so not sure how that one will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community based around this particular niche has been putting out a bunch of speculation regarding price, specs, and release date but I can&amp;#39;t find anything solid from the actual brand. As we are already a week into July I doubt they will be released this month now but time will tell. Even if the brand releasing these products would just confirm the specs and price I can start knocking out the bare bones of some articles with the correct information but until then I will just focus on growing my newer domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed a compeating domain in this niche that seems to have used a tool like AHRefs to scan my domain and pull the keywords that it is ranking in Google for. The new compeating domain is only publishing articles targeting keywords that my domain is already ranking in the top three of Google for but their on-page SEO is not as good as mine and from what I can tell, they are not doing any off-page SEO either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I am not taking this compeating domain as a threat but if they do start to build backlinks to their content and fix the on-page SEO issues they are having I may have to spend some cash on this domain to get it stronger backlinks so it can keep ranking for the terms it is pulling traffic for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain 4 - $284&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/yU8FACm.png""&gt;Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/iXAvaCj.png""&gt;Income&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/C9srhY4.png""&gt;Wordcount&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This domain is the one I started in January 2020 and it surprisingly saw some really solid growth in both traffic and income considering the problems it is having. Essentially, there is an issue with the Google indexing system right now that they have confirmed they are aware of but seem to be struggling to fix. They &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/XJJqcIA.png""&gt;tweeted out&lt;/a&gt; at the start of June that they had fixed the issue but the comments on the twitter post and my own experience contradict this with some people on twitter saying that the &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; actually made it worse for their domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/fGfkNrO.png""&gt;This is a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of this domains coverage tab from my Google Search Console and as you can see from the verticle bars, there was a dip in the pages that were excluded from the Google Index when I used the force index option in Search Console but Google kicked the pages backout of their index a few days later again. It&amp;#39;s a shame because I have a bunch of keywords ready to go for this domain but I don&amp;#39;t want to put the time and effort into publishing them only for them to not get indexed in Google and not be able to pull traffic and make money so I will be waiting until Google fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had a bunch of people reaching out about this issue and how to fix it but it does just seem to be a gamble right now. Force indexing in Google Search Console fixed this issue for this domain for around a week before Google kicked the articles out of their index, for Domain 5 I used the exact same force indexing system and it fixed the issue for the domain. I&amp;#39;m just hoping that Google can work out what&amp;#39;s actually wrong and fix it asap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain 5 - $1.87&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/95cqN1q.png""&gt;Analytics - Google Traffic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/dd8wBQs.png""&gt;Wordcount&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the domain that I launched on 1st May 2020 only for Google to release their 4th May 2020 update and make the keywords that I was targeting on the domain much higher competition. For this niche the Google update seems to have given sites like YouTube, Reddit, Quora, and Amazon much more weight in the SERPs and pushed them really high on page one. Although Domain 3 was also hit by this update dropping by around 20% in traffic (starting to see some recovery now), that niche was not hit anywhere near as badly as this one and I can definitely see how some people were reporting &amp;gt;80% traffic drops back in May for their blogs after taking a more in-depth look of how the update affected this niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the keyword research for this domain that was done in April is pretty much useless now due to the update. That said though, I have spend some time using my post 4th May update keyword research method to try and find keywords to grow this domain in the future once I am done with Domain 6. Although I have been able to find around 50, it is much harder to do in this niche now due to the way the May 4th update hit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep flip-flopping between trying to find more keywords to get it up to 10,000 monthly sessions so I can get it on Ezoic or Monumetric for the higher display ad income or just scrapping it and letting it die and going with a new niche for my display ad project. I am kind of using keyword research for this project as a way to break up the monotony for churning out the articles for Domain 6 though. I basically smash out an article for Domain 6 and then take a little break doing keyword research for this domain so I will see how many actionable keywords I have by the time Domain 6 is finished and I need something new to focus on content-wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my friends who is more experienced with informational intent keywords for display ad sites has a theory that this may just be an extension to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/gus2bt/my_experience_with_the_google_sandbox/""&gt;the Google Sandbox effect&lt;/a&gt; for some niches/keyword combos. He is having the same issue with his latest domain and has sunk much more cash into his project than I have for mine. I&amp;#39;m not sure if this will pan out but there&amp;#39;s not really anything else to do with the keywords already published on the domain than wait and see if it does pick up at the &amp;gt;6 months of age mark or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generation Two Domains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second generation domains are build using a keyword research method that I am developing after the 4th May 2020 Google update that affected the way I did keyword research for my first-generation affiliate domains above. These domains are also based around being smaller niche sites rather than large multi-niche sites so if a competitor does scan my domains with a tool such as AHRefs, they only get a small portion of the keywords for my full money site network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/8OD0WZ2.png""&gt;Wordcount&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This domain has been my main focus for July and it was launched around the 1st June with the Wordcount count above. I have freelance writers helping me with the content for this domain and they are focusing on the longer buyer guide type posts for higher search volume/higher competition keywords while I am focusing on trying to knock out 50 articles using the &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/shaun-m/comments/gx0biz/using_zero_search_volume_keywords_to_your/""&gt;zero search volume strategy&lt;/a&gt; that I have been playing with over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keywords that my freelance writers are working on are essentially a proof of concept for a theory I have for keyword research after the Google 4th May update and if it works then I will move forward with that method for my affiliate sites. The articles that I am focusing on are based around the latest version of the zero search volume strategy on the theory that as keyword tools usually say the keyword gets zero searches, most people ignore it and they tend to be lower competition and much easier to rank for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the test batches of these keywords that I have been putting on my older domains, these keywords do tend to get traffic, usually, around &amp;gt;50 hits per month but they don&amp;#39;t require backlinking to actually rank in Google. Although 50 hits per month is not much, the last round of this strategy that I tried on domain 3 are running at around $100 per 1000 hits to the domain so with the right item price point, 20 of these articles can potentially bring in $100 a month and they are usually 1000-1500 words rather than 2000-4000 words too. Although its slightly different, Phil who runs &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/hjjfba/ad_revenuecontent_site_case_study_mth6/""&gt;this case study&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that he uses a similar keyword research method and has managed to have his second &amp;gt;$500 month on a domain that is only six months old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this test batch of the zero search volume keywords works then I am actually considering making domain 7 based around nothing but these keywords with zero backlinks to it too as it can be another way to scale. As the method can be used for both affiliate and display ad keywords, I might try to use the method to try find keywords for Domain 5 too but as its a display ad site, the RPM might be too low to make it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"Hi there, I am a freelance content writer and I have been writing blogs and articles for my personal blogs as well as for clients for over three years now. Over this period of time, I have learned quite a few ways to write quality content in the least amount of time possible. 

I am not an expert or anything, I am just sharing my experience and how I write long articles/blogs in the least amount of time possible. Hoping that someone would find this information helpful. Also, I would love to hear from other writers on how you write your blogs fast and efficiently without compromising the quality of your work.

**Firstly, I always keep a list of blog ideas and titles ready**

Most of the time, when I write content for clients, they provide me with a list of topics or titles. But, I always keep a list of ideas, topics, and titles ready when I want to write for my personal blog. As I have noticed, coming up with titles and topics using keywords can take a lot of time. In my opinion, most of the other writers do the same thing but I would love to know if you have any other way of going about it.

**Researching on the topic** 

I know a lot of writers that research along the way but I like to research everything beforehand. It helps me to have an idea of the topic and it helps in my next step of the writing process which is structuring the blog. It also eliminates any fear or laziness because researching and knowing everything there is to know beforehand gives me much more confidence and makes my work much easier.

**Structuring my blog**

After researching, I create headings and subheadings according to what I want to write. Researching beforehand also lets me structure the blog better in terms of providing actual helpful and valuable information. I have noticed a lot of time that writers drift away from the actual topic of the blog because they are writing everything along the way while researching. Researching and having a structure ready beforehand helps me keep the information on the blog relevant to the topic.

**Bullet Points**

Next, I take structuring my blog one step further by writing down key information under each subheading in bullet forms. Doing this makes my work 10 times easier because now I only have to write a few sentences about each bullet point to complete a subheading. Of course, I make sure the arrangement of the information and flow is maintained. I can't just randomly throw information in no order. In simple words, it's the reverse of what you do when you take key points from a long paragraph or chapter and write them in short bullet points.

**First Sentence and Answer Paragraphs**

I learned this from the YouTube channel, *Income School.* What I basically do is, I write a simple and casual sentence that gives the reader a friendly vibe by telling about how I know what I know. I also use their tip on not trying to come off as an expert. If I present myself as an expert in my blogs, people will see through the facade and will not like it. Instead, coming off as someone who is just sharing what he knows from his research and experiences is a far better approach for me. 

After the first friendly and casual sentence, I include an answer paragraph which is basically a conclusion, or a short version of the entire blog. According to the guys on *Income School,* it helps you to win the snippet spot (or whatever you call it on google that displays the short information of your search). However, I don't do this for the same reason. I just think that having a short answer or a conclusion type paragraph at the beginning really engages people to read more. But, I don't write it in the beginning. Instead, I leave it and come back to it after I have written the entire blog so, I can better conclude everything.

**Finishing the blog**

Then comes the last step, which is to finish the blog by writing about each subheading and because I already have my bullet point of key information, it makes the writing process far more quick and easy because completing your work in small chunks is way easier than any other methods, in my opinion.

That's it, guys. Please ignore typos or grammatical errors (if any)

,Blogging,"Hi guys, I’m setting out on a project to write around 50-60 articles over the coming 6 - 9 months. Total words likely in the 50-60,000 region.

I’ll ultimately be publishing these via WordPress (some with Elementor page builder).

Is there a decent tool I should be looking to use for hassle free writing?

I’m also worried that copy / pasting over from Notes might mess with the formatting in WordPress or Elementor?

I’ve read about Bear, Ulysses and Scrieaver. Subscription model putting me off at the moment, but if it makes things much better it may be worth it. I’m not adverse to copy/pasting as long as formatting isn’t taking ages to fix on every post.

If I subscribed for 6-12mnths would I then lose/lock out all my work if I cancelled the subscription once the project was done? given I’m away to sink a fair amount of hours in I’m happy to spend on a decent tool, but don’t want a painful transition into it and out of it!

&lt;p&gt;If I subscribed for 6-12mnths would I then lose/lock out all my work if I cancelled the subscription once the project was done? given I’m away to sink a fair amount of hours in I’m happy to spend on a decent tool, but don’t want a painful transition into it and out of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got the WordPress app so I guess I could write direct into there, but not sure this is the ideal editor either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use iOS as my principle writing platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy to take advice from those “in the know”!&lt;/p&gt;

,Blogging,"So I’m generally curious how in depth everyone is when it comes to doing keyword research in general, and how it fits into their content marketing plans?

Normally I identify a niche and outline what I want to write about, simply based on initial face value interest before diving into AHREFS. 

It could be something around my house, or in my garage, something I’m using or have used before, or want to try and start using more often. It usually comes to me when I’m paying for something, that’s when my mind starts working and saying “hmm, I wonder if this service provider or product seller is really doing well within their business, let me check their niche.”

Whether it’s a product, service, philosophy, it usually comes to me one way or another. Once I have my idea outlined, I begin compiling a list of keywords that I know off hand regarding the niche, then take them into google and start looking at the first ten organic websites than rank for those keywords.

Once I’ve compiled a list of competitors and take a look at their blog and website design, length of content ect... generally looking for the kind of investment raised to build their websites, I tend to add their websites to a list of websites.

Once I do that, I go into my first keyword tool (AHREFS), and depending whether or not they pass the AHREFS research, I’ll jump into others, like Google Trends, or social platforms and market places. Usually though, starting with the competitors websites, I plug them into a site explore/content gap checker to check them for keywords against a domain in an unrelated niche. This is to try to expose as many connections between my competition as possible while not excluding any that the primary/unrelated domain might already have.

Once I do that, I tend to not filter any results from that list, and hand select/bulk add keywords that are relevant to the industry into a keyword list on AHREFS. I do this without caring for difficulty, or length, or volume. Once they’re all added, and I have a healthy amount of keywords (let’s say 200-300) inside of a keyword list, let’s call it (Niche Relevance List), then I jump into that keyword list, change the view mode to ‘All Keyword Ideas’ and normally this expands the keyword opportunities to millions.

That’s when I start to apply filters, and re-add more relevancy keywords. The first filter that I add is one that includes any question related keywords. So this could be “who, what, where, how, why”, you can always use the “questions” selector but I don’t want to limit all other types of keyword ideas using that portion of the tool.

Another way of quickly finding and adding more relevancy to my list is by changing the minimum keyword length to 6. This immediately identifies longtail keywords, and generally I use this process on a wash, rinse, repeat method to quickly raise a niche up to 1000 keywords or more of relevant keyword terms.

From there I start to apply critical filters to my overview of relevant keywords list depending on my business goals behind the niche.

If it’s a new domain, I drop the max KW difficulty to 10. 
If it’s an affiliate blog, I include buyer modifiers.
If it’s a search display blog, I include query modifiers.
If it’s a mix of both, I sort for both of them. (Usually both)

Then, I drop the max search volume to 500 or less. Now I know what you might be thinking, (why would he do dat?), well.. my thoughts are that having a higher search volume keyword = more competition = having to do more out reach and social media = perhaps not providing enough short term #1 positions. 

I also think that if you create content in general that isn’t having a high probability of getting the #1 position, due to lack of authority, lack social signals, lack of age, or lack of content structure/seo optimization ect... may lead to many other things being affected in a negative way. 

Sort of like fighting above your weight equates to losses that may hinder your overall boxing record? Idk, something I worry about.

So, that being said, on average that’s ultimately what I end up with, really easy winnable keyword fights that won’t take all year to rank for, and give me a little bit of niche credibility as the new website starts to rank.

Okay, so let me first take a deep breath!

So, the gates for monetization on my blog have been opened recently.

Long story cut short, I applied for AdSense on 30th June and got approval today(4th July)

So it took me 5 days to get approval.

Some insights on how did I do it.

My website is barely 2 months old(started on 18 May 2020)

To date, I have published 85+ blogs. I am writing three/day consistently since 25 May.

So what's the secret sauce to getting approval?

Well, tbh there's nothing that I did special to get approval.

Some basic things are:

* Three basic pages Contact Us, About Us, Privacy Policy.
* 100% original content (This is important, not a single word did I copy-paste)
* Had around 65+ posts with a minimum of 600 words each.
* Even after I applied for AdSense, I kept on publishing posts as I did normally.

That's about it. I know this is way too generic and the information is already available on the Internet.

What gave me the approval IMO is spam-free content and not making the mistake of applying it in a hurry!

PS: I did not apply from a fresh account, I already had an approved AdSense account. That might have given me an edge if any!

1. Substack - this is a really cool platform, because from the beginning, it's built to be a combination newsletter+blog. It's not like other platforms that are mostly a blog (and hard to integrate to a newsletter) or vice-versa. It doesn't have a lot of customization, but it has monetization through paid subscriptions, and the open/click rate are higher than other platforms (ask me more if you're curious.
2. One of my favorite source for signups is Twitter DMs. I post every day (mostly original jokes and videos), follow people with similar interests, and when they follow me back, I DM them about my newsletter. Quite a few signup.
3. My other favorite funnel for signups is is emailing people from my address book, and the tool I like best is GMass because every step is inside GMail itself using a Chrome bookmark. 50 emails/day for free. Careful to check Gmail limits if you go above that, you can trigger spam alerts.

**Monthly Summary**

Finally starting to see some growth I feel. It is definitely helping to look at weekly/monthly averages rather than worrying about daily visitors.

I also made my first income this month! The grand total of £1.61! haha - This came from an Amazon affiliate link.

I didn't do much writing this month, as I have also started a 2nd blog which has taken up more of my time. With all this lockdown rubbish, I've been feeling a little demotivated to write, and honestly not known what to write about.

I plan to do a lot of keyword research in the first week of July, and then hit the ground running again and try and boost myself to over 100 visitors a day consistently.

I'm still getting most of my visitors to a single post - but I think someone must have shared this post on Social Media, as it is getting a good chunk of those visits from FB &amp; Twitter on a daily basis. This has seen the blog go above 100 visits in a day for the first time, and keep climbing for the past few days. I'm intrigued to see if this will reduce once the social media impact goes away.

**Aim for Upcoming Month**

As I said, I don't think I did very well this month with  the content - I ran out of steam. But I think some better preparation work will help this month.

I am becoming more aware of burn-out when writing my own content - so I'm definitely going to focus on avoiding complete burn out if I can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals**

* One of my main goals for June was to go beyond 500 sessions, and I absolutely smashed that goal. More than tripled it.
* My aim for July is to go to 2,000 sessions for the month
* I would also like to try and work on a better schedule for working on both blogs. The reason for both is to add some diversity to my writing to stop me getting bored of writing about the same thing, and to also try some different things with marketing/affiliates etc
* As with last month, I would like more diversity in my visitors. I am seeing other posts increasing, but the main bulk of visitors are going to two specific posts (with #1 taking about 80% of visitors)
* Still trying to stick to pinterest usage, but really not seeing any benefits.

So before you write a blog for a keyword there is always an important step I do which i wanted to share :).

1. Search the keyword in google and open the top 10 links which are in the first page.
2. Now count the number of links which are blogs/articles and count the number of product pages

If the number of blog pages &gt; product pages then you are good to go

If the number product pages &gt; blog pages do not waste time in writing a blog

The thing is google ranks blogs/articles and product pages for the keywords now if the majority are product pages for a particular keyword then it is highly unlikely for your blog to make it to first page.

If its (6-4 or 4-6) or both are equal then you can rank any type of page

Note - difference should be more than 2 links

You can try to rank any page for any keyword I am just saying which one has a higher percentage of ranking easily.",t2_dxom64,False,,0,False,Before you write content for your keywords Do this!!,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Tips/Info'}]",r/Blogging,False,6,Tipsinfo,0,,False,t3_hjn106,False,dark,0.96,,public,61,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Info,False,61,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1593679478.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Blogging,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So before you write a blog for a keyword there is always an important step I do which i wanted to share :).&lt;/p&gt;

I spent most of the day just trying to set hosting up. I think I created accounts of at least 20 different services. One of them actually asked me to create an account inside of the account. I only had to quit one because my name wasn't available because I had just deleted the account to start over after other stuff got screwed up.

Stuff like the host being unable to find other themes or plug-ins

Stuff like the host being unavailable to even submit a support ticket because they're taking a 5 hour lunch break in the middle of the da

Stuff like getting stuck in a ""Welcome to the world famous 5 minute install"" loop after trying to import the Blogger site which of course was AFTER Wordpress was installed

But hey I finally got hosting figured out, right?! This is where the fun begins, right?!

Well the rest of my entire day was spent in Theme Hell. Whenever I hear someone say, ""WordPress is easy once you learn it,"" I ask, ""What exactly do you mean by **it**?"" Everything works differently so if you have a problem you're not going to find help unless someone else has also used that theme.

I currently have 14 themes installed - why the hell doesn't it automatically uninstall them after you switch? - and they're all crap. You see an enticing thumbnail and after you install it your site looks nothing like that thumbnail. Then you work and learn how the theme works and before you know it you've found half a dozen things you don't like so you have to pick a new theme and *start over*.

And the Blogger transfer? Please! I assumed the back up would download all of the images in the blog and then when importing they'd be added to the media library. But they're still just linking to the images hosted on the Blogger site. This means I have to go through each one and manually re-download the images so I can set Featured Images and such. And the formatting is jacked up on the posts too so no matter what I am basically redoing all 300+ of my posts by hand - **which is one of the main reasons I never wanted to switch**.

WordPress is literally killing me. I have thrown my computer across the room. I've given up and gone back to bed 5 times since noon. I can't take this anymore and I have **no idea** why you people act like this is the only way to make a blog.

I've said a million times that if Blogger ever shut down I'd retire before switching to WordPress. Well the new Blogger is unusable and the world is on fire so I retired. But even though I was too depressed to blog a month ago I still spent most of the past month depressed because I *wasn't* blogging. So I thought I'd join you all in the light. Turns out it's the dark side.

I don't get it. I seriously don't get it. I look at WordPress and I see hell. Yet everyone acts like it's the best thing on the internet.

And what really pisses me off is all these housewives making bank talking about what kind of dish soap they use while I can't even get hosting to work. Every time I quit today I just went on my phone and saw nothin but blogs. I honest to god turned off my phone and head it in my drawer for a few hours because there's nothing there that makes me happy.

Blogging is stupid but it's the only thing that makes me happy in the world so if WordPress is the way to go then here I am. But Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ I'm going to be the first person to be killed by WordPress.

I’ve been using AHREFS and other tools to do KW research and I’ve mostly targeted keywords that are under 10KD, but have high search volume and are relevant to my industry. On average though many of my selected keyword targets are less than 4 difficulty.

A majority of these kw’s are long tail, and I’ve also invested time into checking the SERPS for each keyword to ensure that the competition on average had a lesser word count, image count than my articles.

I’ve also included unique images on every post, and followed a SEO checklist publishing these posts which includes things like interlinking, external linking, and content structure like H2s, H3s... ect...

The website loads in under 3s, has a very low bounce rate (50-60%, sometimes much lower on other pages), and time on page is usually around 3 minutes.

Long story short, I’ve published roughly 90 articles in 90 days following this rigid publishing process. The website is new and doesn’t have many backlinks (less than 10), but has 1/3 of its traffic coming from social media, 1/3 from organic search, and 1/3 from direct.

When I check into the search console, and google analytics, I can see that 99% of the content is indexed, but less than 10% of the content is ranking in positions above 30.

The monthly clicks, impressions, and unique users is always in the green between 10-100% depending on which metric you look at, but it seems as if it should be in much higher volumes, especially considering a majority of my keyword targets have little to no backlinks on average, less images, less words ect...

The website is currently averaging 350-400/monthly visits, which is strange because I’ve seen websites hit those numbers without as much as a single blog post and no keyword research.

I now have my domain and hosting. 

Now when I visit other Wordpress bloggers, I'm unable to post a comment or like their posts. It's requiring me to create a Wordpress account. Now I saw the option where I can create a Wordpress account but retain my original domain name via ""domain mapping"" 

I did my research on this, but I still don't get it. What I want to accomplish is for me to be able to comment and like posts of other Wordpress bloggers with my domain name. I'm not sure if domain mapping is really the answer. I just want to be sure before I pay.

I have been trying to decide on a domain name for the past 6 weeks, and I've narrowed it down to two; I need you to help me pick one: **LivingDavidALoco** dot com or **MediumOfEscape** dot com.

I have been told by multiple people both online and offline that I should start a blog.

The quick story as to why people say that: I was previously homeless and self-taught myself web development as a means to get out of the crappy life I was living. So, I moved in my car to Denver where I slept on side streets and walmart parking lots while I taught myself web development and went to meetups and eventually got my first job offer in Boulder, CO.

It's a few years later now and I will be able to retire from the rat race within the next 3-5 years due to living as if I make just $12/hr while I make around $115k per year, and investing the rest.

I've also been able to do some cool stuff in my life: skydiving, trekking the Peruvian Andes, white water rafting in the Pico Bonito National Forest in Honduras.

So, naturally, people keep saying they can't get enough info about how I did it, how I'm doing it, what I'm doing, and how I've kept my mind focused on enjoying the process and progressing rather than getting sad and giving up.

So, rather than only writing on forums and reddit, I want to just start my blog and get content out there.

I'm stuck. I have two domains I've settled on, and I just need someone to help determine which is better:

1. LivingDavidALoco dot com
2. MediumOfEscape dot com

Both will contain the same material: stories from my past, photos and videos of some cool stuff I've done, the way I view money and work, saving money, investing, minimalism, frugality, travel, etc.

,Blogging,"Hi /r/blogging,

I want to set up a custom-programmed personal website/blog, and post to it using an iPad. I prefer writing in markdown.

My original idea was this: blog to a hidden Wordpress-powered website using the [iOS Wordpress app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880) - could be standalone, or powered by wordpress.com. Then, have my actual public-facing website read the Wordpress database internally, and render the posts. 

So first, I tried the Wordpress app connected to the basic wordpress.com blog [with markdown enabled](https://wordpress.com/support/can-i-use-markdown-on-wordpress-com/), but the posts still render the mark up literally. So must be the iOS Wordpress app doesn't support it.

My backup plan was then to write using the built-in iOS Pages app, and publish it via sharing the document to an iOS Shortcut, that would then send a POST request directly to my website backend. However this seems kinda complicated, especially since I won't be able to edit the posts once I send them. 

So I'm curious if there is a workflow (any workflow) to post to a custom website? It can be wordpress-powered, or custom PHP-powered. If there's an industry standard publishing format that I'm missing (could be something like reverse RSS, I guess?), I can implement it on the website.

Please let me know if you know! Thanks :)
