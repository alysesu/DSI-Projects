,writing,"Your critique submission should be a top-level comment in the thread and should include:

- Title

- Genre

- Word count

- Type of feedback desired (line-by-line edits, general impression, etc.)

- A link to the writing

Anyone who wants to critique the story should respond to the original writing comment. The post is set to contest mode, so the stories will appear in a random order, and child comments will only be seen by people who want to check them.

This post will be active for approximately one week.

For anyone using Google Drive for critique: Drive is one of the easiest ways to share and comment on work, but keep in mind all activity is tied to your Google account and may reveal personal information such as your full name. If you plan to use Google Drive as your critique platform, consider creating a separate account solely for sharing writing that does not have any connections to your real-life identity.

Be reasonable with expectations. Posting a short chapter or a quick excerpt will get you many more responses than posting a full work. Everyone's stamina varies, but generally speaking the more you keep it under 5,000 words the better off you'll be.

,writing,"A few years ago, I saw a Reddit thread between readers. One said ""What if you had one story, but nine different endings. You publish nine different books--all the same story with a different ending, none referencing the others. Then, later when people ask about its canon, say you have ten versions."" Excluding the last piece, I did this. The book has 7-8 believable, different endings with a red herring in the middle hinting at which ending is in that book. (Cat ending, dog ending, alicorn ending, dragon ending, etc.) But is it possible to publish 7-8 different books with different endings with the exact same story, blurb, price, publish date, etc.?

I really love the different endings and the concept, but if put to gunpoint I could choose one. I just don't want to. The book is completed and all endings will be canon, as a nod to the multiverse theory. Also, if you love the angst of a major character death, you can choose your favorite and ignore the others or vice versa. All endings contribute lore so they're all important. I have no delusions people would buy multiple books, but rather look it up on YouTube or Tumblr or something. I mostly care that people enjoy the story as writing won't be my day job.

If I can't publish it under the same title multiple times, could I fit all the ending chapters at the end, all labeled ""Chapter Cat"","" ""Chapter Dog,"" ""Chapter Alicorn,"" ""Chapter Dragon,"" etc.? Or would that make the long book look even longer?

,writing,"It can be hard to find people to give feedback on your work, and organizing novel exchange groups can be prohibitively time-consuming and challenging to organize. That's why the Toronto Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers created a flexible novel exchange system.

The way it works is super simple: you look at a list of novels that people want feedback on, and sign up for whichever ones you'd be interested in reviewing. You accrue credits based on the word count after attending the feedback meeting for that novel. If you have a novel that you would like feedback on, you put it on the list, and accrue a deficit based on the word count and the number of readers (you can choose the cap on the number of readers). That's pretty much it.

If you're thinking, I don't have time to read novels, you've just answered why it is so hard to find people to read your novel. The good news is this system lets you read at your own pace, so you could read a short novel or novella here-or-there to accrue credits.

If you're interested in joining, just let me know and I'll get you set up. You can also find what you need here: [https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Science-Fiction-and-Fantasy-Writers-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Science-Fiction-and-Fantasy-Writers-Meetup/)

That&amp;#39;s why the Toronto Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers created a flexible novel exchange system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way it works is super simple: you look at a list of novels that people want feedback on, and sign up for whichever ones you&amp;#39;d be interested in reviewing. You accrue credits based on the word count after attending the feedback meeting for that novel. If you have a novel that you would like feedback on, you put it on the list, and accrue a deficit based on the word count and the number of readers (you can choose the cap on the number of readers). That&amp;#39;s pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"Ranging from a wide range of sources and stylized since the earliest civilizations, the idea of a ""return"" has always come with a sense of vigor unsatisfied by preceding stories of both realism and fiction. Characters who manage to fall and then come backed with rejuvenated spirit or altered personality have always made for greater storytelling with wider dimensions (even the Bible capitalizes on this literary device). Many pieces of beloved fiction take this to the ultimate form in the trope ""Getting the gang back together"" during which time the protagonist/lead  must reunite an old crew or posse in order to achieve their goal.

During this trope's arc, the audience rekindles relationships with characters, and the separated time has allowed those characters to change or mature so they now offer a greater depth to their backgrounds, histories, knowledge, and flaws. Due to this capacity for enthrallment, this trope is a candidate for one of the greatest writing devices in literature.

It is absolutely one of the strongest ways to reengage an audience into a drama. Almost literally any season changes in television series do this. Most sequels to movies and books. And pretty much Every Super movie. It's so effective because it demands the audience reinvest themselves in understanding the characters they thought they'd begun to know, building mystery, tension, and possibility. A protagonist could become an antagonist. A child could become an adult. A star could become a black hole. Regardless of the change, the idea of reinventing oneself and reuniting with a group of similarly, or increasingly changed teammates, is always effective.

So, could it very well be one of the greatest literary devices in fiction? Please share your thoughts.

I’ve been following this channel for a while an I finally decided to ask a question that’s been burning in me for a long time.

I find that I’m capable of coming up with cool ideas and I have a blast developing them: plot, characters, overall arch, etc. I even write a substantial chunk of the book itself but I quickly hit a block and I seem incapable of finishing it. I’m pretty sure I suffer from ADHD so it’s very difficult for me to ‘go back to them’ later. 

Is there a way to sell these ideas and characters to someone else? Or should I just hire a ghost writer to finish the job? I’d really love to see some of my ideas in shelves (or just finished, what the hell!) so I’m a bit lost on what to do.

They didn&amp;#39;t enjoy themselves much over it, just a bit. So, they didn&amp;#39;t like it that much. None of them did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want people to be affected by what i have written. Not just have some slight enjoyment from it and not even have been affected enough by the work to even talk to me about it. The equivalent of my work they might feel as to eating a snack. A small bit of enjoyment, nourishment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be a fact in this world that there&amp;#39;s always going to be writers that do not rise above being bad. And also those who never rise above something...alright. Decent. Okay. Not that good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do i deal with that. Even if i spent time improving, what if in the end it&amp;#39;s the same.&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"Bear with me. This is a bit of a ride.

Right. So, I love reading non-fiction resources like journals and essays. I'm a through and through academic. I've just finished a postgraduate in practical theology where I wrote c.10,000 words on reflective practice and literature reviews. I love that shit.

I love reading about human culture, relationships, and history. War is fascinating. I love watching televisual media about that stuff, both fiction and documentary.

So, here's the issue:

In my mind, I've imagined an entire world full to the brim of people, culture, history, places, empires new and old, and technology. I have imagined an entire timeline of when things happened and who was involved. To me, it's as real to me as real life.

The problem, though, is I *detest* reading fiction. Especially modern fiction. I don't want to spend six paragraphs reading what a tree looks like; gimme the geopolitical specifics upfront! As such, I have no fiction writing skills. If I could write about my world like some sort of academic text, I'd be all for it. But writing it as a fiction? I'd rather headbutt a moving bus.

So, I'm stuck. I have a wonderful world that's stuck in my head, and I want people to know about it. But I'll never write it because I don't have the skills to write fiction.

,writing,"Hi! 

So basically when I listen to certain (mostly instrumental) songs I picture a scene in my head. So for example, there is this one song that makes me think of a boy running through the streets of a village, running away from a guy who’s place he had trespassed.

I like to connect these different scenes from the songs to picture how it could be sewn together to make a bigger story. (Don’t have a lot of scenes yet to make a full story though)

But anyway, my question is... is it worth keeping this and maybe writing them as they come, and eventually into an actual story? Or is it a waste of time? Because I don’t really have a passion for writing (never actually written anything before, just some scenes) but I’d like to think that every now and then I write a couple of scenes, then in a few years I might have a whole book that could go somewhere?

And it’s kid of like... it’s not the writing that I’m interested in... it’s just the scenes that I’m interested in/excited about, and think it would be an interesting story/movie/whatever it ends up being. 



So should I write it down, in case it becomes something/a one time side thing, or forget about it since I’m not a writer and it would be a waste of time?


Edit: also I don’t mean that I expect it to be a famous book or movie... I just mean, maybe I can self publish it even if it just means 10 or so people see it, but should I even hold onto these ideas “in case”, or since it’s not a big passion, move onto something else?

Edit: also just wanted to add that when I say “I’m not a writer”, I **don’t** mean that my method/inspiration of ‘writing’ is ‘wrong’ therefore I’m not a writer... I mean that I literally hardly ever write anything (just these scenes as they come), I don’t read all that much either. But I have in the past tried to “write” (a watt pad story when I was younger lol) (stopped because wasn’t passionate about it and *tried* to make the story happen instead of just let it come when it comes) and researched how to actually write a story, etc (plot, character development, etc)",t2_481uyw84,False,,0,False,Is it worth writing this?,[],r/writing,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_ilo3i3,False,dark,0.57,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,1,,False,self,1599114546.0,,[],{},,True,,1599142417.0,text,6,,,text,self.writing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! &lt;/p&gt;

I'm pretty sure everyone knows about famous 'Hero's Journey', how the hero encounter classic stages like meeting the mentor, the mid-point, the lowest point and the reversal and rebirth. It is all very informative and illuminating to a new writer like me.  


But that often encapsulates one single journey.  


What if I want to write something longer than one small journey?   


What if I want to write a long series, volume after volume, then how should I plan out the LONG journey for the hero?   


Sequels are typically less successful than the prequel, although obviously there are some exceptions out there. I feel like authors can only plan one single great book and the rest can't live up to their original book (Like the Locke Lamora series), I believe it has something to do with the narrative mentality of the Hero's Journey.  


It is classic, but it doesn't expand on the sequel culture of the publishing industry. So I think there must be some way to plan ahead for the Hero's Long Journey, there must be more steps before the hero can reach the final point of his destination.

&lt;p&gt;What if I want to write something longer than one small journey?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I want to write a long series, volume after volume, then how should I plan out the LONG journey for the hero?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequels are typically less successful than the prequel, although obviously there are some exceptions out there. I feel like authors can only plan one single great book and the rest can&amp;#39;t live up to their original book (Like the Locke Lamora series), I believe it has something to do with the narrative mentality of the Hero&amp;#39;s Journey.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is classic, but it doesn&amp;#39;t expand on the sequel culture of the publishing industry. So I think there must be some way to plan ahead for the Hero&amp;#39;s Long Journey, there must be more steps before the hero can reach the final point of his destination.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your thought?&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"Quick rundown on what an  Epistolary novel is,  

&gt;An **epistolary novel** is a [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel) written as a series of documents. The usual form is [letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(message)), although [diary entries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary), [newspaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper) clippings and other documents are sometimes used. Recently, electronic ""documents"" such as recordings and radio, [blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogs), and [e-mails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mails) have also come into use. The word [*epistolary*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epistolary) is derived from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) word ἐπιστολή *epistolē*, meaning a letter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The epistolary form can add greater [realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)) to a story, because it mimics the workings of real life. It is thus able to demonstrate differing points of view without recourse to the device of an [omniscient narrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscient_narrator). An important strategic device in the epistolary novel for creating the impression of authenticity of the letters is the fictional editor.

To help him throughout the journey, he adopts another name to help keep his identity hidden and he is referred by his new name throughout the rest of the story (with it being used every now and then by himself or other characters).


The name change happens pretty early on and so I just wanted some opinions and advice on whether introducing the character with one name (his real one) and then changing it to another one might be a bit confusing or whether the reader will adapt pretty easily to it.

Despite it having what I feel is a very slow pace, Burroughs managed to draw me in and keep me reading. So fast pace may not be the key to keepin' 'em turning pages.

Danger and Stakes? Stories that can somehow quickly get us to understand the stakes at hand may keep us reading. On the other hand, without character building, the stakes don't mean much; why does it matter if a character I don't care about yet is in danger?

Reading Level? If a book is supposed to be, say, for Young Adults, and you load it up with college-level words, those may serve as ""speed bumps"" for your readers and lead them to put the book down.

Building curiosity? Both with movies and books, there are storytellers who get a lot of flack for being hacks. But one thing they do well, which covers a multitude of their sins, is build curiosity.

I'll briefly mention two: Dan Brown and J.J. Abrams.

Dan Brown gets clowned by more ""serious"" writers for his prose, his reuse of themes, and, well, lots of stuff. But damned if he isn't good at building curiosity. In *The DaVinci Code,* when Robert Langdon's hotel room door gets knocked on late in evening, and he has his coat put on him and is whisked into the night, you're curious. When we're ""shown"" the polaroid of the old man, naked on the floor, we're hooked -- why is the man in the Vitruvian pose? We're turning pages.

J.J. gets joked on for his ""Mystery Box"" comments. But, on paper at least, ""mystery boxes"" are a damned good idea: begin to open up something on the first few pages that the audience gets curious to peek into. So, in *The Force Awakens*, our first few shots of Rey are as a masked figure scavenging around a crashed Star Destoyer. Who is this man or woman? And why is there a crashed Star Destroyer?

In *Cloverfield*, not a lot of time is wasted before, boom, the Statue of Liberty's head gets knocked off. What the hell is going on? Is this a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or what? Everybody out to the street. Now we're running. What are the cops shooting machine guns at? Curiosity galore.

Of course, Abrams is also good at opening mystery boxes (Who are Rey's parents? Where'd Luke's lightsaber come from?) that he does a dogshit job of closing.

All of which makes me suspect that you can be weak in quite a few areas of writing (plotting, dialogue) but if you can succeed at creating curiosity, you can succeed at writing.

,writing,"Hey all,

To cut to the chase: I don't know whether or not I should give up on my first book.

I've spent several years writing and re-writing and editing it, and I recently felt that it was finally time to reach out to find an agent. Whenever I think about the book during my daily life, I feel good about it. Looking through it for any last minute edits, I think it looks fine. However, as soon as I sit down to write some query letters, it's like I finally see the book for what it truly is. I think of so many different parts that others would probably see as being terribly written, sections that I think are fine only hours before, and that number seems to grow whenever I even think about finding an agent.

However, this isn't the biggest part of the problem. I have dozens of other ideas for novels, some of which I have almost the entire story outlined and am very eager to start on, but I feel that I shouldn't even begin to write them without publishing the first book first.

I still care about my first book. I like the characters and the world, but I just feel so torn.

So, my question is this: Should I continue working on my first book? Do I try to nail down every last section or story beat that feels wrong, when that number seems to be never ending? Or, should I shelve it for now, and move on to a fresh start, where I can apply what I learned from all those mistakes?

,writing,"Let's talk about guilt flags. What is a guilt flag? A term I made up a few days ago, but fundamentally a concept that's been around for a very long time and has often been discussed (there's probably already a term for this, but I haven't found it). 

**A guilt flag is an event or trait that results in a character losing sympathy, increasing feelings of distrust, disdain, vengefulness, antipathy, schadenfreude, and annoyance, usually coupled with a desire for punishment.** In media, guilt flags are often an abstract McGuffin used to tell a guilt trip story— i.e. a character(s) does something wrong and seeks forgiveness, to varying degrees of success. Sometimes, the story doesn't focus on the direct effects of the guilt flag itself, but carrying it does color the character in some way, giving them some extra flavor to their personality (unless the guilt flag *is* their personality, in which case they're probably a fairly flat character).

There are three central focal points: the Carrier, the Victim, and the Audience. 

The Carrier is the one who carries the guilt flag, the guilty party in other words. Their arc revolves around this guilt flag; if they ignore it, the Audience (in-universe and readers) will constantly question why they face no retribution unless that's just a common thing in the story's universe. 

The Victim is the one against whom the Carrier acted against or directly affected. This one is the most variable. 

The Audience is everyone else, whether fellow characters in universe or readers/viewers. An In-Universe Audience will likely shame, guilt, arrest, and/or try to kill the Carrier depending on the severity of what they've done. The Readers usually won't have a say in this, but they ultimately determine whether atonement has occurred and forgiveness is merited.

The typical arc of a guilt trip storyline can be summed up as ""each of these four archetypes forgiving the Carrier."" For a 'successful' arc, they all have to generally decide that the Carrier's been sufficiently punished and/or rehabilitated. If one of them doesn't, then the Carrier becomes either a Karma Houdini or a complete Woobie. It might also affect the story and characters in various ways.

If the Victim and the two Audiences forgive the Carrier but the Carrier themselves can never forgive themselves, that might lead to self-hatred and depression on their part— but also melodrama and self-pity in others' eyes. If only the Carrier decides they've suffered enough (or even refuses to feel remorse or guilt at all), they'll probably be seen as narcissistic, sociopathic, annoying, and deeply in need of being smacked down— the longer said smackdown is delayed, the more gratifying it becomes when it happens. The the Carrier and the Victim return to good terms and the In-Universe Audience also accepts this conclusion but the Reader Audience thinks the Carrier got off too light, they've chosen their new Scrappy and this character will always be scrutinized. If only the Victim refuses to forgive or at least accept atonement, *they* might be seen as too harsh and intolerant, *especially* if the Readers don't agree with them to boot.

And so on and so forth.

***Many factors affect the size of the guilt flag— the severity of the Carrier's actions (if there are any actions at all), who the Carrier is, and the context of their actions are the biggest ones coming to mind.***

In any children's show, guilt flags are used often to teach a lesson. Character A will do something that inconveniences or annoys Character B, so B tries getting back at A in a way that proves disproportionate is a fairly common plot, but sometimes B gets back at A in a way that *is* proportionate and satisfying— and sometimes, A is guilty over doing what they did and, rather than B trying to get back at them, A instead spends the episode trying to make it up to them to get rid of the guilt flag. 

Let's imagine Adam deliberately ate a cookie meant for Beatrice. That's a very small guilt flag in 99% of situations. Even in an over-the-top story, the worst we'd expect is that Adam and Beatrice aren't friends for a day. Imagine if Beatrice decided to shoot Adam in the head, and then told police, ""He ate my cookie."" Unless this is a cynical black comedy or set up to some psychological horror, *that's an atrociously disproportionate reaction.* Adam's action did *not* warrant death. What he did was a tiny bit assholish, but outside nerd kvltvre cynics and psychopaths who go out of their way to be as misanthropic and ironic as possible, Beatrice just lost audience sympathy overwhelmingly. 

Think ""Code of Hammurabi"": an eye for an eye. The closer to equivalency you get, the more justified and satisfying the reaction is. The more disproportionate (one way or the other), the more frustrating it gets. Of course, the Carrier can face *slightly* more disproportionate retribution and still see audience schadenfreude against them— if they pluck an eye, both of their eyes can be taken out and people won't feel too sorry for them. If they're blinded as well as burned in acid and crucified, then yeah, the audience is going to start saying, ""This is going way too far.""

Things get even more harrowing for Beatrice if Adam is a child. In most cultures, children are seen as inherently more innocent, and therefore we let them get away with more than we would older teenagers and adults. That only goes so far and up to a certain level of actions, but generally Adam's actions won't evoke such extreme antipathy if he's 8 years old and Beatrice is an adult. If it's the opposite— Adam is an adult and Beatrice is a child— he might get *more* antipathy than otherwise because he just made a child upset. And that's really just the start of how much who a character is can affect a guilt flag.

To show what I mean by *context* changing everything, the guilt flag changes completely if Adam is a fascistic aristocrat who constantly and sadistically torments Beatrice— an impoverished, mentally broken vagrant whose only joy in life is getting this cookie. The sheer schadenfreude of seeing Adam shot in the face means that the Audience places unto Beatrice no guilt flag or a very small one at most (barring those types who think Adam's completely in the right). 

#But let's say it's not a cookie but rather murder. 

This time, it's just a normal suburban neighborhood and Adam murders Beatrice. He then spends the rest of the story wracked by guilt and remorse over what he's done. The question becomes ""does he ever attain forgiveness and atonement?"" The answer is *deeply* complicated. More optimistic stories will say that him just being really, really sorry will eventually lead to reconciliation. More pessimistic and realistic ones will point out that no, there are some things he can't quite overcome. 

The most optimal situation in any guilt trip story is of the Carrier completely losing their guilt flag. They can freely associate with the Victim as though nothing can happened.

On principle, that's not possible with anything where the Carrier has killed or permanently mentally crippled the Victim. So even if the Carrier has all but become Jesus Christ in the eyes of the audience, there will always be at least *one* character to which they are unable to lose their guilt flag. 

To some in the Audience, taking another's life is an unforgivable guilt. There is no possible path to redemption other than death. But for others, forgiving murder or manslaughter is as simple as begging forgiveness or doing a few good deeds. And depending on the story, genocidal maniacs can become white-hearted heroes in everyone's eyes within a few arcs just because they decided to rescue a puppy and kept acting from there.

Sometimes, one of the chief Victims might be the Carrier themselves. This is especially common in what I call ""Original Sin"" guilt trips. These being tales where the Carrier is guilty because of *who* they are rather than what they've done. Because of the circumstances of their birth, their relations, their friends, and/or some other trait fundamental to who they are, they are cast as guilty and in need of redemption— if possible. Of course, the actual Victim remains those who were wronged by the Carrier's relations; they just blame the chosen Carrier and punish them as well.

This is an easy one with which an author can evoke audience sympathy for the Carrier/Victim because they're ""guilty"" of something they did not do. It's also easy to mess up because the (reader) Audience may get constantly frustrated by them trying to redeem themselves if the characters' situation never improves and they themselves are not disagreeable or unlikable. Indeed, it runs the risk of invoking the trope of ""Then Let Me Be Evil""— if the Victim and In-Universe Audience decides that a character born with a guilt flag or forced to carry one *cannot be redeemed* for whatever reason, then for many Readers, that justifies them living up to the flag and actually gaining a reason to carry it. Punishing a character for breaking only invokes frustration (up to a point).

(Just to mention it: being framed or scapegoated means that the Carrier is carrying a false guilt flag; these stories are usually about them proving they're not guilty or taking the fall for someone else).

It does have to be stressed that the Carrier does *not* have to feel remorse or want to atone for their actions, nor does the Victim or Audience ever have to forgive them. Indeed, the Victim can forgive the Carrier, but the Audience may not. Likewise, the Victim may never forgive the Carrier, but the Audience may want to coddle and protect them. 

_______________

*My personal favorite* is a guilt flag somewhere between a moderate-sized one (e.g. ""Adam broke Beatrice's arm and made her miss a big dance"") and an ""unforgivable"" one (e.g. ""Adam sexually tortured and murdered Beatrice""), one where a character's redemption is not guaranteed but also not impossible; the Victim is still alive &amp; possibly even quite well and the Carrier experiences deep, extreme remorse. But simply feeling remorse and perhaps even acting on said remorse does not change what is done. The Victim ultimately gets to decide what redemption looks like. For the Audience however, the Carrier has to basically be thoroughly humiliated and almost broken down before they can be forgiven (and they might not be forgiven after all that)— but, critically, the Audience also has to feel that there's still a red line that shouldn't be crossed. Actually *killing them* or torturing them or something of that caliber will quickly evaporate negative feelings towards them. That's too harsh. If the Victim was traumatized, for example, then even if the Carrier is remorseful, the Audiences will usually tolerate them traumatizing the Carrier back. But if the Victim actively tries to, say, tie them up into their basement and torture them or actively drive them to suicide, they will have completely lost sympathy and Readers especially will feel no pity in someone coming in and putting two between the eyes. As a result, there's actual nuance; you can't take the easy way out, and there *are* several paths forward. Not all optimal, but not all negative either.

#One of the big themes of any guilt-based story is that of *consequences*. If there are no consequences, what's even the point?

Any good one should have lasting consequences: trust may be shattered and never recover, but with enough atonement and redemption, it may actually grow stronger. The cause of the guilt flag may have instead been the trigger needed to upset a broken status quo, and everyone's actually better off for it. The Carrier will usually always be held in some level of suspicion, especially the more heinous their actions get. Bad events happening to the Carrier will usually be seen with less severity than those that happen to others. People will tolerate more negative events occurring to a Carrier until the guilt flag is formally dropped— and for some, that may never happen. Even if you're falsely accused of something and forced to carry a guilt flag and then convincingly and totally prove your innocence, there will *always* be some people who associate you with the flag and decide you're a liability— others may doggedly insist you did it against all evidence because that's just what they heard first or because they just don't like you. Friendships may be permanently broken. Recovering from carrying a guilt flag may only allow the Carrier to claw back to a much lower level than before— if they were once the leader of a group, the best they can do now is as a low-level grunt. Marriages and unions may be broken, and the trust needed to bring them back may never be restored no matter the redemption arc's conclusion (though this is rare and fairly nihilistic).

#This is getting pretty long, but I hoped I got the point across.

To recap succinctly, a guilt flag is the set-up for a redemption arc. That doesn't mean a redemption arc actually happens or ends happily; it's just why a character needs to be redeemed if at all.

If there's anything I was unclear about, let me know; I've only recently tried organizing my thoughts on this point and really needed to turn over every stone myself just to see if I understood what I was talking about.

And if there is an established term for a guilt flag, *please* let me know.",t2_fphp2,False,,0,False,"On Guilt Flags: character sympathy and punishment (usually) has to be logical and proportionate, lest readers feel something's off",[],r/writing,False,6,advice,0,,,False,t3_ikr9xo,False,dark,0.57,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Advice,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1599018113.0,text,6,,,text,self.writing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about guilt flags. What is a guilt flag? A term I made up a few days ago, but fundamentally a concept that&amp;#39;s been around for a very long time and has often been discussed (there&amp;#39;s probably already a term for this, but I haven&amp;#39;t found it). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A guilt flag is an event or trait that results in a character losing sympathy, increasing feelings of distrust, disdain, vengefulness, antipathy, schadenfreude, and annoyance, usually coupled with a desire for punishment.&lt;/strong&gt; In media, guilt flags are often an abstract McGuffin used to tell a guilt trip story— i.e. a character(s) does something wrong and seeks forgiveness, to varying degrees of success. Sometimes, the story doesn&amp;#39;t focus on the direct effects of the guilt flag itself, but carrying it does color the character in some way, giving them some extra flavor to their personality (unless the guilt flag &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; their personality, in which case they&amp;#39;re probably a fairly flat character).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three central focal points: the Carrier, the Victim, and the Audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Carrier is the one who carries the guilt flag, the guilty party in other words. Their arc revolves around this guilt flag; if they ignore it, the Audience (in-universe and readers) will constantly question why they face no retribution unless that&amp;#39;s just a common thing in the story&amp;#39;s universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Victim is the one against whom the Carrier acted against or directly affected. This one is the most variable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Audience is everyone else, whether fellow characters in universe or readers/viewers. An In-Universe Audience will likely shame, guilt, arrest, and/or try to kill the Carrier depending on the severity of what they&amp;#39;ve done. The Readers usually won&amp;#39;t have a say in this, but they ultimately determine whether atonement has occurred and forgiveness is merited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical arc of a guilt trip storyline can be summed up as &amp;quot;each of these four archetypes forgiving the Carrier.&amp;quot; For a &amp;#39;successful&amp;#39; arc, they all have to generally decide that the Carrier&amp;#39;s been sufficiently punished and/or rehabilitated. If one of them doesn&amp;#39;t, then the Carrier becomes either a Karma Houdini or a complete Woobie. It might also affect the story and characters in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Victim and the two Audiences forgive the Carrier but the Carrier themselves can never forgive themselves, that might lead to self-hatred and depression on their part— but also melodrama and self-pity in others&amp;#39; eyes. If only the Carrier decides they&amp;#39;ve suffered enough (or even refuses to feel remorse or guilt at all), they&amp;#39;ll probably be seen as narcissistic, sociopathic, annoying, and deeply in need of being smacked down— the longer said smackdown is delayed, the more gratifying it becomes when it happens. The the Carrier and the Victim return to good terms and the In-Universe Audience also accepts this conclusion but the Reader Audience thinks the Carrier got off too light, they&amp;#39;ve chosen their new Scrappy and this character will always be scrutinized. If only the Victim refuses to forgive or at least accept atonement, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; might be seen as too harsh and intolerant, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if the Readers don&amp;#39;t agree with them to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many factors affect the size of the guilt flag— the severity of the Carrier&amp;#39;s actions (if there are any actions at all), who the Carrier is, and the context of their actions are the biggest ones coming to mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any children&amp;#39;s show, guilt flags are used often to teach a lesson. Character A will do something that inconveniences or annoys Character B, so B tries getting back at A in a way that proves disproportionate is a fairly common plot, but sometimes B gets back at A in a way that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; proportionate and satisfying— and sometimes, A is guilty over doing what they did and, rather than B trying to get back at them, A instead spends the episode trying to make it up to them to get rid of the guilt flag. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s imagine Adam deliberately ate a cookie meant for Beatrice. That&amp;#39;s a very small guilt flag in 99% of situations. Even in an over-the-top story, the worst we&amp;#39;d expect is that Adam and Beatrice aren&amp;#39;t friends for a day.

What he did was a tiny bit assholish, but outside nerd kvltvre cynics and psychopaths who go out of their way to be as misanthropic and ironic as possible, Beatrice just lost audience sympathy overwhelmingly. &lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"I understand the way people use the phrase ""They are the heroes of their own story,"" however, I think the better version is ""They are the protagonists of their own story."" Here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

The word hero suggests that the character believes they are in the right, or that they are doing righteous acts. However that isn't always the case. Some characters are bad and they know it. They aren't trying to do good, and have come to understand and accept that. A protagonist is one who, for the sake of their own story, must grow, overcome, learn, adapt, and push themselves to the limit to achieve what they want.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that nine times out of ten an interesting protagonist must do either of two things. They must develop as a character to overcome their lie, or overcome obstacles that stand in the way of their truth. This is why a protagonist is more interesting than other characters who may be static or unchanging and don't play a major active force in the story.

&amp;#x200B;

If we see a villain character struggle to rise above the rest and best challenges that even our heroes would hassle against, we become more invested in the villain. To humanize our villains is to give them something to struggle against. An internal struggle will earn sympathy. An external one will earn admiration. Using these elements we give agency to the villain and make them seem like they are on the road to achieving their own goals. A similar road our protagonist is on. It parallels their journeys, and sets up a more interesting dynamic in the readers mind.

&amp;#x200B;

We don't always need justifications for a villain, we just need to understand their character. We need to know what drives them and what makes them like us. Do they have to deal with injustices, with hardships, and confusion? This may not apply to ever type of villain or antagonist. But I believe it gives a good indication of how we can humanize them and make the audience care about them by simply asking, if they were the protagonists of their own story, what would happen?",t2_2fxhu2cm,False,,0,False,"Villains are the ""heroes"" vs ""protagonists""",[],r/writing,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_ikoqzo,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,0,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1599010292.0,text,6,,,text,self.writing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand the way people use the phrase &amp;quot;They are the heroes of their own story,&amp;quot; however, I think the better version is &amp;quot;They are the protagonists of their own story.&amp;quot; Here&amp;#39;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"Hello all,

I was wondering if everyone could post their writing habits.  I am trying to get really good at the craft, and I want to develop a structured plan  to get me there (I have very little free time).  Here is what I'm planning to do.  Any suggestions are welcome. 

1. Three pages of freehand every morning.  I try to record dreams in vivid detail, any events from the previous day or any strong emotions that are coming up.  I try to be mindful of word choice, grammar and syntax, but I do not put pressure on myself to make everything sound pretty (although sometimes it does, to me at least).  The point here is for me to reduce inhibition and hesitation (I've been blocked for years) and become more creative and psychologically perceptive.

2. Choose a quote from an author I like and memorize and rewrite it to understand its structure and effect. Then I try to create my own sentence using the same syntax.  This practice has helped me expand my writing tremendously. 

3. Writing exercises: I have a book called Spellbinding Sentences that I do exercises from.  Basically, the book has different sentence patterns you can imitate, and it teaches you how to experiment in a fun way (I highly recommend this book, at least for beginners like me).  After I'm done reading Spellbinding Sentences, I will read books on plot/other aspects of writing. I want to be working on at least one skill at a time. 

4. A little bit of polished work each day (I have several short stories/pieces I'm trying to work on at once and I simply choose whichever one inspires me most that day and spend at least 20 minutes writing or editing. 

5. I also try to keep a reading journal where I record interesting words and my favorite quotes from book and songs (I am not disciplined with this though)

6.  Go on one artist date a week.  An artist date is an idea from a book I read on creativity.  You basically plan a 2 hour chunk of time to do something novel by yourself in order to ""get in touch with your solitude,"" or your original perspective.  You ""fill the well"" of your mind with interesting experiences that you can draw from when you write.

,writing,"Hello Everyone! I'll do my best to keep this on the shorter side. (Heads-up, not the most positive post)

My story: When I first started college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. After my first year, I went to a community college part-time so that I could get my Associates, but work at the same time. During my last semester, I received a email promoting the creative writing certificate at the college. While it intrigued me, I decided to take the summer to mull it over because that meant more college, which meant more money. But, as you may have guessed, I decided to enroll in the classes. I took several different courses, including fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. I found that I thoroughly enjoyed taking the classes and that it rekindled my love of writing. It's been a few years since I took those courses or have done any creative writing because I've been busy completing my Bachelors and I've had a few other things going on. 

I know that there may be the potential that I am overthinking things, but I am starting to wonder if I am even a good writer (which is depressing tbh). I can't help but to think back to that year of creative writing. While I received mainly positive from my peers and professors, I can't help but to feel that it was obligatory. Why? Because the comments seemed surface-level, and maybe that was just because my peers were more unfamiliar giving feedback, but I felt that from my professors also. Not only that, but when the other creative writing certificate earns and I had our ""ceremony"" (it was really small. There was less than 15 of us getting the certificate), each professor had a student to write and sing praises to. The professor that had me, I had been in several of their classes and I really liked them, basically said how good I was at putting in the work to rewrite my pieces. That was it. But for the other student that she had and for the other professors, they complimented how great their work was. And clearly this is something that has haunted me for the past few years.

I'm a communication designer and I've started a zine collection called the *""Short Stories Series"" (SSS)* as a platform for creative writers to self-publish short pieces and distribute freely. Basically you write the stories, I'll make the publication.

*My goal is to accommodate 100 creative writers in getting their work out into the world.*   
You can check out details and even download previous SSS issues [on my website](https://www.ezszmz.com/sss).

Initially it was limited to my friends in Canada and Indonesia but I would love to open up the floor and get writers from all types of backgrounds! Looking for (at least) 10 new writers this month.

If you're interested, details for September are below.

September theme: *Shame and Glory*  
Maximum: *2000 words*

,writing,"I don't know who first said that to me, or if I read it first. I've always like this idea, perhaps since I quite like writing dark characters, and in some works the villains are my favorite. The thing is, what I like most are complex characters, some of them are good and have lines they don't cross, but others might give you the chills if you spend any time in their heads.

Recently, I watched Silence of the Lambs for the first time. Before I saw it, I'd seen it mentioned on a few youtube channels. One of them dissected the scene where the main character meets the villain. As I was doing some brainstorming for a character of my own, I began thinking of that movie and a thought occurred to me. Does the villain in Silence of the Lambs know he's the Villain? My thoughts went a step further; are there villains out there that know this? Would my story be better served if my villain was self-aware? 

I remember watching cartoons. Most of those villains didn't have self-awareness. Then there are ones like Zuko, who, the moment he gains full-awareness he enters the redemption arc. He isn't like 'oh, my father does terrible things, let's join him' which is what it takes, really, to be a self-aware villain. (Which makes me wonder if his father was self-aware that what he did was terrible?)

There are a lot of protagonists out there I wouldn't call heroes, sure. Of these, there are a variety that are self-aware.

Should they be considered as a protagonist in their own story? Each of these descriptions has a different feel to it, in my opinion, and builds a different sort of character.

Hi everyone, I was so excited to find this sub! I’ll keep it as short as possible!

I currently have three published books (a trilogy for young adults), and am working on something new. I thought it was a really cool and kind of unique idea, even though it has some well-used tropes, if that makes sense? Kind of a new spin on stuff that’s been done before.

Today I saw a trailer for a new movie that looks exactly like the premise of my book! I’ve read a little more on it, and there are differences of course, but the theme, setting, and general idea is so similar.

I’m almost finished writing the book, and was hoping to send it out to my beta readers, and then my publisher to see if they like it... but now I feel like everyone’s going to think I totally ripped off a movie.

I think I should make my whole world first before starting with the plot. I already have a vague idea, but I want to keep it on the sidelines.

Those little phrases you use to convey a small action the character does to break up dialogue and just kinda give that extra bit of description, such as: 

She shook her head and sighed softly before biting her lip, her eyes glossing over. 

""I know what you did, Joey. I know everything. It's--..."" 

She trailed off, her chin trembling and her voice breaking with every other word. 

""It's better if you and I-..."" 

She sniffled and looked into his shocked eyes with her porcelain ones. 

""Pretend we never knew each-other.""

'He bit the inside of his cheek' 

'He bit his lip' 

'He clenched his jaw/fist/teeth/' 

'He smiled softly, gently.' 

'He laughed quietly, softly, gently' 

etc, etc.

I am finishing the first draft and as I go over the portion I wrote the day before I just feel so... disheartened. I can't write metaphors anymore. I can't spice up my dialogue.

I do not understand why this is happening. I consider myself a pretty avid reader and what I do read is broad: poetry, indie coming of age novels, fantasy, international literature, memoirs, etc. So I'm not sure why my voice, all of a sudden, is so tired and the cache in my head is empty.

,writing,"Hello,

I'm trying hard to improve my writing and have been working on mostly technical/non-fiction stuff like blog posts, but I'm really eager to start trying out creative writing/fiction! I was hoping to find a book that might help me out with my weak points - I'm looking for something that talks about the actual style, flow, wording, sentence structure, etc. I'm having trouble finding something because almost all the books I can find for fiction writing seem to be more about creating the plot or characters, worldbuilding, or the writing process whereas I'm really looking for something more about improving my actual wording/sentences (I hope that makes sense).

One book I read and loved was [It Was the Best of Sentences, It Was the Worst of Sentences: A Writer's Guide to Crafting Killer Sentences](https://www.amazon.com/Was-Best-Sentences-Worst-Crafting/dp/158008740X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=it+was+the+best+of+sentences&amp;qid=1598832158&amp;sr=8-1) by June Casagrande. I really got a lot out of this, but now I want something more focused on fiction/story telling and style. While this book had sections on things like dangling modifiers, passives, punctuation, and adverbs, I'd love something focusing more along the lines of stuff like varying sentence length, how to write a good description (show not tell), how to make a paragraph flow, word choice, writing dialogue, portraying emotions, etc.

I was hoping to find a book that might help me out with my weak points - I&amp;#39;m looking for something that talks about the actual style, flow, wording, sentence structure, etc. I&amp;#39;m having trouble finding something because almost all the books I can find for fiction writing seem to be more about creating the plot or characters, worldbuilding, or the writing process whereas I&amp;#39;m really looking for something more about improving my actual wording/sentences (I hope that makes sense).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One book I read and loved was &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Was-Best-Sentences-Worst-Crafting/dp/158008740X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=it+was+the+best+of+sentences&amp;amp;qid=1598832158&amp;amp;sr=8-1""&gt;It Was the Best of Sentences, It Was the Worst of Sentences: A Writer&amp;#39;s Guide to Crafting Killer Sentences&lt;/a&gt; by June Casagrande. I really got a lot out of this, but now I want something more focused on fiction/story telling and style. While this book had sections on things like dangling modifiers, passives, punctuation, and adverbs, I&amp;#39;d love something focusing more along the lines of stuff like varying sentence length, how to write a good description (show not tell), how to make a paragraph flow, word choice, writing dialogue, portraying emotions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any recommendations would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"I had a premise for a playful/sexy meet cute for a romance... I have buhz-dozens of ideas for stories. This was my first attempt to write it-at least the discovery phase of what the background was on this story, the setting, etc.

It's gone from this fun, funny, sorta light-hearted , probably mildly erotic romance... To a suspenseful, murder mystery, maybe even a heist thrown in there somewhere.

,writing,"Hi all,

I'm working on a novel that is ""technically"" New Adult but since that's not really a genre anyone is publishing, I'm pitching it as an Adult Commercial Fiction (In a sentence it's about a small town Drag Queen in her early 20s, but not a coming out narrative).

&amp;#x200B;

I initially had it as YA but I've since learned that since my protagonist isn't a teen, it won't sell (he has to be at least 21 so she can perform in bars in the US). There isn't really anything too adult beyond some dirty jokes and talking about sex. My first question is: is my instinct to go with pitching this as an adult novel the right choice given the age of my protagonist? I keep running into this problem with LGBTQIA+ focused novels because most of us don't get to explore their sexuality until post high school which takes them out of YA territory age-wise. I've asked a similar question in the YA writers sub but I'm curious what people coming from the opposite end of the question think too.

&amp;#x200B;

My story is coming to a close around 60k words. Is that too short? I can add more scenes with character and stuff but I'm worried because I was lucky enough to have a large part of my previous work critiqued by a very famous author who used to be a professor of mine and he said that I spent too much time with my characters lolligagging around just being cute and fun and nice. My plot moved too slowly. I've written this novel at a bit of a faster pace with less ""fluff.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the sake of conversation, let's just assume that what I've written feels like a full story and that as it stands, it doesn't NEED more writing for it to all make sense. I'm not saying that's the case but I'm trying to avoid ""write as much as you need to to tell the story"" type answers. I'm looking at this from a trad. publishing point of view only. Maybe I'm a sellout, but I write to get published.

&amp;#x200B;

SO: (TL;DR) Will a low-ish word count really kill me if I try to sell a commercial fiction book at around 60k words? I can add more, but I'm hesitant to do it just for the sake of adding words.

&amp;#x200B;

But if as a debut author I need to stick to the norm of 75-80k words, I'll make it happen. I just want to write chick-lit for gays.

So, I've been working on this fictional universe for a long time now, because I intend to use it in a lot of different stories that I want to tell. 

One of my main objectives fleshing out this world, since it's an alternative Earth, is giving representation to most cultures that, together, form the plural Identity of my native country, Brazil, where most of the narrative will unfold.

So the story is that i started to write a grimdark fantasy trilogy, and im already done with the first book, and im nearly finished the second. The first one is 332 pages long and in this moment the 2.nd is 371 but its gonna be like 400-450 pages, when its done. I have the whole story in my head and im still very motivated but that is my first serious project. (I have written smaller novels before but those are not finished or just really bad or boring.) 

And this is the part where I need help: The first book is totally finished but there is no cover image to it, because its only exists in Word document. A have ideas about cover images but im really bad at drawing, and one of my friends told me he could do it for me. Is that ok, or i should do it? (again, i really can't draw!) 

And the other matter is the publicing. Im only 16 years old and i picked a school about healthcare, wich is not really optimal for a wanna be writer.

Rowling did with the H.P. series, to say a well known example.)

My dream is to be an offical book author and i've got a lot of great unique ideas for other books and book series, and if I could, i would write and edit a lot more, but my free time is little. 

So please, someone who is familiar with book publicing and writing, tell me how is it work? I read a lot about this on different blogs, and some of them feels totally bullshit, and every site says different thing than the other.

Back to my original point. If there's a little detail or something that doesn't entirely make sense, call it out yourself! Beat them to the punch.


I'm writing a superhero story and at one point the protagonists come into conflict with some yakuza people. Someone asks (paraphrased) ""What the hell are the yakuza doing in the american midwest?"" To which someone else says they have no clue and it's probably something secret.


Do I the writer know why? Hell no, I just thought it would be cool. But now the reader at least thinks maybe I have a cool secret reason for it.

Same can go for magic/technology. There are some characters with advanced suits that allow them to control elements. A character asked how they worked, to which another replied ""How should I know? I'm not a scientist.""


Do I know how they work? Not really. Will I come up with an in depth explanation? Maybe eventually. Either way, the reader feels like the lack of explanation is because the characters themselves don't know, not because the author is lazy.

,writing,"Hi everyone! I will try to explain my dilemma here, sorry for my English but is not my first language.
Back in 2013 I started a story and then stopped writing it (even if I already had the whole (more or less) plot in mind). It was my first serious story and I loved it. 

In 2018 (I think) I started a new one and even with this one, I had the all plot in mind but after a while I stopped (in both cases it was also because I suffered from depression and it was not easy for me continuing doing it). When I tried early this year to continue the one from 2018, I was stuck because I found difficult to write it since I cared about it a lot and I didn’t think I was mature enough (as a writer) to write it. 

So about a month ago, I decided to continue the one from 2013 because I always cared about it and I was sad I never finished it. Since then, for the first time, I wrote basically everyday and now I almost finished the first book. (The point is that they both are not standalone books, but they are gonna be a saga, with at least 3 books).

Now, I was curious and I read the first chapter I wrote of the 2018 story. I fell in love instantly and remembered why I loved that story so much. 
The point is that love them both, the 2013 because it was my first story and I love all the characters, the plot, everything, and I care about it a great deal, but it’s more simple, the 2018 otherwise is sooo much different and I’m very proud with everything I decided for that world. It’s also more mature and I think that the story is better.

I want to write both of this sagas, that’s for sure. 
The problem I have now is that I find myself wanting to write both of them at the moment. I was writing the 2013 first but after I read the first chapter of the 2018 one I felt that I also wanted to continue that one.

,writing,"**UPDATE:** Thanks to some wonderful replies, I think I've realized that I'm using the wrong terminology here. I've learned that you should avoid sentences starting with a dangling participle or a misplaced modifier. I found a blog article on the topic that was illuminating: https://www.english-grammar-revolution.com/dangling-participle.html

So, if I could rename this title, I'd say ""Stop starting sentences with dangling participles/misplaced modifiers.""

There are others in here saying what I'm really complaining about is ""adverbial phrases,"" but whenever I look those up, none of the sentences look like the sentences I'm using as examples.

---

Gerund: a form that is derived from a verb but that functions as a noun, in English ending in -ing, e.g., *asking* in *do you mind my asking you?*.

Here are some examples of my own:

&gt; Dancing the night away, their feelings for each other grew.

&gt; Flying through the clouds, they squealed in delight.

&gt; Holding his hand, they walked off into the sunset. (ironically, I think this is a rare example that works better without a restructuring)

...and so on. Every time I write a sentence starting with a gerund, it sounds awkward when I read it, especially if I read it out loud. For this reason, 99 times out of 100, I restructure my sentences that start with a gerund during editing.

But, I notice a lot of amateur writers starting sentences with gerunds all the time. I understand why: it's a very easy way to restructure a sentence, especially if you've got too many sentences starting with the subject and you want to mix it up.

Every time I ask, I'm told that starting a sentence with a gerund is perfectly fine, but I still feel like it sounds weird most the time. Here's a better way (in my opinion) to structure the first two examples:

&gt; Their feelings for each other grew as they danced through the night.

&gt; They squealed in delight as they flew through the clouds.

&gt; They walked off into the sunset, holding hands. (as I said, I think the original has better structure. To make this version Palatable, I had to remove ""his,"" and technically change the meaning of the original. That said, maybe someone out there can think of an even better structure than the original -- one that I'm not seeing)

I'm currently reading a book that won a Hugo award. I think the prose flows well, so I wanted to test my gut feeling about this. I read a whole chapter, looking for sentences starting with gerunds, to see how often this professional uses them. I only noticed one: `Shaking, Syenite lowers her hands slowly.`

There may have been others I missed, but (in this chapter, at least) the author seems to agree with me: Avoid sentences starting with gerunds.

I found a blog article on the topic that was illuminating: &lt;a href=""https://www.english-grammar-revolution.com/dangling-participle.html""&gt;https://www.english-grammar-revolution.com/dangling-participle.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I could rename this title, I&amp;#39;d say &amp;quot;Stop starting sentences with dangling participles/misplaced modifiers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are others in here saying what I&amp;#39;m really complaining about is &amp;quot;adverbial phrases,&amp;quot; but whenever I look those up, none of the sentences look like the sentences I&amp;#39;m using as examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerund: a form that is derived from a verb but that functions as a noun, in English ending in -ing, e.g., &lt;em&gt;asking&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;do you mind my asking you?&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of my own:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dancing the night away, their feelings for each other grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying through the clouds, they squealed in delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding his hand, they walked off into the sunset. (ironically, I think this is a rare example that works better without a restructuring)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and so on. Every time I write a sentence starting with a gerund, it sounds awkward when I read it, especially if I read it out loud. For this reason, 99 times out of 100, I restructure my sentences that start with a gerund during editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I notice a lot of amateur writers starting sentences with gerunds all the time. I understand why: it&amp;#39;s a very easy way to restructure a sentence, especially if you&amp;#39;ve got too many sentences starting with the subject and you want to mix it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I ask, I&amp;#39;m told that starting a sentence with a gerund is perfectly fine, but I still feel like it sounds weird most the time. Here&amp;#39;s a better way (in my opinion) to structure the first two examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their feelings for each other grew as they danced through the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They squealed in delight as they flew through the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They walked off into the sunset, holding hands. (as I said, I think the original has better structure. To make this version Palatable, I had to remove &amp;quot;his,&amp;quot; and technically change the meaning of the original. That said, maybe someone out there can think of an even better structure than the original -- one that I&amp;#39;m not seeing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently reading a book that won a Hugo award. I think the prose flows well, so I wanted to test my gut feeling about this. I read a whole chapter, looking for sentences starting with gerunds, to see how often this professional uses them. I only noticed one: &lt;code&gt;Shaking, Syenite lowers her hands slowly.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may have been others I missed, but (in this chapter, at least) the author seems to agree with me: Avoid sentences starting with gerunds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"By now, I'm sure we're all very familiar with this common piece of advice. I think there is some confusion with it though.

A few months ago, I completed my plan for one of my characters' arcs and I was super excited about it. I'm still excited about it. The other day I explained their history to someone and they thought it was cool, too, but after I gushed about how much I loved this character, they looked at me and said, ""Well, you know what they say: you have to kill your darlings."" I lost my passion in that moment and we moved on to other things.

The thing is, killing your darlings doesn't mean that every time you love something in your story, you should (literally) kill them or take them out. Don't steal your own passion. You're writing a story because you're passionate about the characters, you're invested in the plot. There would be no point otherwise.

In the case above, my character and his arc was central to the progression of my main plot. It was important to my other characters just as much as it was important to me, as the writer, in my own daydreamings. It's a completely different thing than if this character's arc divided from the central theme of my story. If that character had gone on a side quest that had nothing to do with the MC, and I got really invested into this side quest, but again, it didn't follow the main plot or theme, then I would justifiably have to ""kill my darling."" For example, in a story about a characters making a long and time-pressed journey, if they stop in a village for *three chapters* (instead of a scene or two, or, at the most one chapter?) and have a little side story with the villagers there, you're going to hurt not only the reader's attention, but maybe even your plot. Obviously this isn't concrete, but you get the idea.

Killing darlings isn't about cutting passions, it's about trimming back distractions. And if your character or side plot becomes so exciting to you that it seems almost more important than the MC or main plot, but is still parallel to your central theme, that's okay. Maybe alter your plot so that this exciting one that keeps growing isn't off to the side. Do whatever you have to do.

,writing,"Hello!

So, I recently decided to start writing (my first novel :,)), and I'm wrapping up the planning phase/starting to type chapter 1.  I've actually been lurking here for a bit, looking for tips, but I have been so overwhelmed by the content available... 

First, there are the ""do not do this or I will drop your novel""/""major pet peeves"" type posts that I've been taking note of. Stuff such as ""don't describe your character by having them look into a mirror"" or ""don't have a main character that deals harshly with henchmen but is merciful to the final boss"" or ""don't even think about touching certain cliches (like the misunderstanding trope that leads to an unnecessary, avoidable mess)""

Then, there are other types of things to keep in mind such as ""vary sentence length"", ""Make sure your characters all speak in a distinct/personalized way"", ""don't invent too many new words"", ""every scene should further the main plot"", etc.

There have been many helpful resources as well such as tips for how to make consistent progress, how to describe skin colors,  what differentiates third person limited and first-person POV, etc. 

The lists for all 3 categories could go on and on, and I'm sure there are many other tidbits that warrant a new category. But, I guess what I'm trying to say is, there's so much information that I'm not sure where to start or how to proceed.  For example, with the ""do not introduce your character's appearance by having them look into a mirror"", I understand why that's the case. But then, how much farther does the mirror cliche extend? What other ways of introducing appearance are lumped into the same category? I'm worried, and I look at what I wrote so far and wonder if my introduction of my protagonist's features is executed in a clumsy manner. This dilemma happens with all the other ""things not to do/to keep track of"" type advice, and I rapidly lose confidence in what I'm writing. This is my first novel, so I've accepted that it'll be amateurish in execution. However, I still want to bring the story to life to the best of my ability. 

What are your thoughts, experiences, advice, insights, or anything really? How have you guys dealt with this in the past, and/or how do you avoid these ""off-putting elements"" as writers now? I would greatly appreciate any feedback! If you read this far, you're a champ :)

One thing I hear a lot of this sub is that you need to read a lot, which I do. 

The problem? I don’t read sci-fi. I’ve never read a single Syfy book before (tried to read one when I was a little kid but it was too advanced for me and I didn’t even know what was happening half the time, so I quit)

&lt;p&gt;The problem? I don’t read sci-fi. I’ve never read a single Syfy book before (tried to read one when I was a little kid but it was too advanced for me and I didn’t even know what was happening half the time, so I quit) &lt;/p&gt;

Earlier today, I had this sudden epiphany regarding the disgust I feel towards my own writing. It's still beyond me where this feeling comes from, but I can now define it. You know how your spoken voice sounds like ""whatever"" to you when you speak, but sounds terribly off in every audible property when you listen to a recording of it? That's exactly it!

The common advice I hear about the voice thing is that you just gotta trudge though recordings and get used to it. Well, I've been doing argumentative writing for a long, long arse time. When I go back to my old writing, it's solid technically, pretty effective even, but still feels convoluted. I've made money writing and translating business correspondence, and, again, it's correct but stinks. However, this feeling is overwhelming when it comes to fiction. I cannot stomach it.

,writing,") You need to build a habit of writing everyday. Same time. Same place. Everyday. It will be hard definitely in the beginning but if you keep at it, the workflow comes naturally. I know alot of writers struggle with sitting down and writing. The thing is, it's only a matter of initial 5-10 minutes. Once you get past that, you actually get into the mood and mindset to write. Building a habit also eliminates any excuse for you to depend on sole inspiration and motivation. 


2) Start with short stories. Ray Bradbury advised writers just starting out to focus on writing one short story a week. By the end of the year then, you should have 52 stories and by no means, you will have all 52 stories bad. The point here being, you should focus on writing so much that you're not overtly attached if one or two or even ten of your stories fail. Because you need to learn that your worth is far beyond just one project. Also, short stories provide you with an easier ground to practice your craft. If you get into writing a novel straightaway, you will probably not get it right and might just give up. Work on your craft through short stories. Get rid of the million clichés out of your system before you finally tackle the novel. 


3) Always read stories atleast twice. First, read for entertainment. Read for the pure joy at being pulled into a beautiful world and watching interesting characters go about their lives. This is the reading where you are reacting to the story. If possible, do mark which parts of the story grab your attention the most. On your second reading, examine these parts specifically. Break it down. Analyse what techniques did the writer use to create that effect on you. If there was something that didn't work for you, try to figure out why it didn't work. To improve your reading skills as a writer, I would suggest you read ""Reading like a Writer"" by Francine Prose. Really amazing book. 


4) Read across different genres. My MFA people had this elitist attitude which made them confine to only the serious literary texts and completely disregard popular fiction. Now everyone has their own preference but you shouldn't be looking down upon any type of writing. There's alot you can learn if you read with an open mind. Popular fiction, the really well written ones, can help you with constructing a gripping plot that keeps the reader hooked from the very beginning till the end. It can teach you how to build tension, suspense and conflict. Literary fiction can teach you how to write beautiful prose which sings. It can help you paint a vivid imagery with words. It can also help you to deepen your characters. So read in your genre/preferred writing but also read beyond your comfort zone. 


5) All great stories have a point to make. We tell stories because we have something to say. Stories are the best way to do so because it helps us develop an emotional connection with the readers and when they are emotionally involved, they feel much more inclined to listen and understand what we are trying to say. You can obviously lecture them but...how many of us hate it when that is done to us? Anyway, if you want your story to stand out, think for a moment about what you want to say. If you can summarize your story in one sentence, it would be great. 


6) For the love of God, please be aware of your own thinking and internalised prejudices. I have seen many talented male writers write women horribly. Most of them succumb to describing their female characters by focussing on their boobs, nipples or god knows what all sexual characteristics. By doing so, you're defining them by only their sex. You're telling the world that there isn't really anything more to them than boobs and nipples and an ass that swings when she walks. Please. Please. Be better. We live in a patriarchal society and we are so imbedded into this beliefs that we are not even aware of this. Please take the time to question your perception. Question yourself as to why do you think the way you think. I would suggest, research helps alot in this. Especially if you're writing a life you're not familiar with. 


7) Grammar and Punctuation. I can't stress enough as to how important this is. If this is not done right, it might even get you rejected by agents and publishers way before they get to the interesting parts of your novel. It's as important as any other part of your story. Please don't forget this. 


8) Editing. I would suggest you switch off your internal editor when you're writing the first draft. First drafts are meant to be shitty. Just do a word dump. Write whatever comes to mind. From the second draft onwards, edit mercilessly. Read ""Self Editing for Fiction Writers"" by Rennie Browne and King. 


9) I know you might wanna get published but don't write solely for the sake of getting published. Write because you love writing. This is a career filled with a string of rejections. A lot of rejections. And if your love isn't string enough, then you won't be able to make it through till the end. 

10) In continuation to the above point: No matter how many times you have been told to give up writing because it won't make any money, or how many times you have been told that your own writing is bad....

This advice, and the article linked below, has helped me tremendously in advancing my writing. 

The tl;dr version is basically this: verbs like the above and others that allow you into the character's mindset aren't unpacking everything that is making them think/feel such things. Create a scene that unpacks or implies that the thinking and the reader will do the heavy work of ""oh, they must be feeling X"" or ""That person must want Y"".

I'll admit even after reading and applying this, I still am guilty of the occasional ""realizes"" or ""remembered"". As with anything, this is more of a guideline than a hard and fast rule, but it does offer a better way of unpacking the emotions and context of characters and scenes, making the reader want/think/feel the things your characters want/think/feel without explicitly saying so.

,writing,"I always thought writing is 100% creativity, and I grew up reading books like 'Harry potter' or 'The Lord of the Rings'. I read more than 100 stories and none of them were the same.

Then one day I saw a post in r/writing about the phrase 'Nothing is new under the sun'. The post said that every plot and character possible was already done. I was shocked because that was not what I have thought at all. And my dream being a (Game) scenario writer I was 2x more frustrated.

I thought about the subject a LOT. And I found that there were possible flaws in the concept 'everything has been done' and here is it.

1. The number of possible stories are just too much. I hate the concept of 'Tropes' (For me thinking about them ruins my emotions while reading and writing) but let\`s say there are 1,000 tropes that exist today. and 100 tropes will be used in a long story. that\`s 1000! divided by 900! and that well surpasses the amount of stories that were created during human existence. Plus, I asked in reddit and a lot of people said creation of new tropes was possible. (Just think about the possible themes. Was there ever a story about the bases A T G C of a DNA talking about how to create and manipulate a human to their success? My idea.) Add them up and BOOM! you can always write a different story.
2. No one is the same. People write up different stories and stories almost always reflect the author\`s thinking, life, etc.
3. If all stories that can be made were made, there will always be copyright issues in every movies, novels, etc... There must be a spot of creativity in every story, so that it wouldn\`t be like that. 

But..the question still remains if I PROVED this, whether I\`m wrong, or the 'creativity' I\`m talking about is just a small part and everything else is 'tropey'. 

And about plots. If I created a plot that is like A-B-D-G-E-A again-O-K-Q-ending P(sort of) will it already have been used? Can you always create a plot that didn\`t exist before? I don\`t mean the classic 7 plots like 'The hero\`s journey'. I don\`t care if I see them 1000 times. I just mean the 'specific' plot, like the plot of 'Angels and Demons'. \*possible spoilers\* (A killer chases the protagonist, you look from place to place at old relics to find the next killing place, the killer dies by the protagonist, surprising villian twist and so on...) 

I just care if they will always be different... and that I will be able to make ones different from all the others.

,writing,"Hi all, i was watching something that kept me on the edge of my seat and it made me think how it was doing it. I started to understand that it was setting some things up subtly, so I've created what i think what was happening.

Caveat: this is not gospel or a formula to always follow, if you have your own way of doing things that's great and it's definitely encouraged not to follow this religiously.

So How to create a tense scene:

1) Set up a bad thing that is going to happen, basically make it clear that someone is going to die or get injured or worse if the chararcters don't try to do something. (Sometimes this can just be inferred by the audience, dead bodies in forest = bad thing for forest dog walkers. Or it can be skipped if audience has prior knowledge, jewish person in ww2 Germany doesn't need any set up)

2) Have the thing that will cause the bad thing be present in the scene. Have whatever it is constantly try to foil the chararcters in making it to their goal. If the chararcters need to get somewhere the bad thing that wants to kill them will try to make them falter.

3) Show things that could go wrong, and if you want to add even more tension make them go wrong. (Sometimes inference is enough, if the chararcters need to get away by car you can just add tension by having the car splutter, you actually don't need the car to break down. This is all about the anticipation in the audience that something will go wrong)

4) Continue on with this, constantly making bad things that scupper the chararcters from doing what they need to do, until the thing the chararcters need to achieve is done or the bad thing catches up to the chararcters (third way is the chararcters decide to face off with the bad thing, but this should be done sparingly because any subsequent bad thing will feel less frightening if the chararcters win)",t2_j7rj9,False,,0,False,A rough guide to making a tense scene,[],r/writing,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_ihvax0,False,dark,0.73,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1598596975.0,text,6,,,text,self.writing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, i was watching something that kept me on the edge of my seat and it made me think how it was doing it.

The question I then usually ask myself is, if I'd rather get up early (being rusty and all, barely having started when I need to stop and go to 'real' work) or if I do it late (slowly, without much real creativness and many unnecessary mistakes; or with a big flow of creativeness and getting to bed way too late, having problems doing it the next several days).

That's not to say that you should name your characters after the sounds that Cthulhu makes in the bathroom whenever he eats Taco Bell. Make your names easily memorable, and make them sound fine and fitting &amp; you should be fine.

What REALLY matters is everything else: how you design your character, if the story is interesting, what their personality is like, how they talk &amp; act etc etc. The reason why those names sound great is because of the story behind it.

,writing,"Dear writing  community,
After years of hesitations, self-doubt, procrastination, and so on, I started writing. As for many aspiring bloggers, I opened a Medium account and started publishing on it. Today I have something to celebrate: my first month of writing.

As you may have already guessed from my question or from the text below, I am not a native English speaker. I consider myself an English learner, and yet I am willing to become an English writer.

Because I want to put what it takes to succeed, I started a challenge with myself: writing 100 articles in plain English over the next 30 days. Each article must have a minimum of 500 words. But by the end of September I shall have published 100 articles.

While I see many advantages in pushing myself into discomfort, I also have moments of doubts: is it really worth it? Shouldn't I first try to learn how to write in French before trying to become a writer in English? And most of all: is it actually possible to become an English writer? I know that in theory, this is possible (through hard work, commitment, passion, dedicated work, ...). But do you know any, or are you yourself, people who became ""successful"" English writers? (by writer I mean ""who makes a living out of writing"", so a blog in English counts as one yes)

If yes, how did you practice? What seemed the most efficient to you? What do you wish you had known earlier?

,writing,"I have a revision note from an editor to make sure I stick to close 3rd person POV by not slipping into the minds of other characters. 

The example he gave was a dialogue tag that hinted at the personal thought of a non-protagonist—this is easy enough to fix; however, I’m wondering how far the close 3rd person needs to go when describing character actions in general. 

For example, if my story is all about character A and his/her observations of the world, if I add a sentence like, “character B put the groceries in the car,” would that still qualify as close third person so long as character A witnesses the action (of putting the groceries in the car)? 

Do I need to specify character A bearing witness to it? Ie. “character A watched character B put the groceries in the car.”  I hate repetition, so I don’t want to oversaturate the story with “he/she watched,” “he/she noticed,” etc., especially if it’s implied.


Even if character A—the protagonist—witnesses character B’s action, does it break the “spell” of close 3rd person if the focal point is shifted to something character B is doing? 

For example, if character A has a paragraph of observation, and the next paragraph starts with “character B put the groceries in the car,” does it weaken the POV, especially if there’s not something in the sentence to connect it to character A? 

Maybe a better close 3rd person sentence would be: 

Character B put the groceries in character A’s car.

OR 

Character A watched as character B put the groceries in the car.


I am fully aware that I may be overanalyzing this. 
The note I received may be more about fixing parts that imply thoughts of other characters, as opposed to actions that focus on other characters.

The most notable example is when a good friend has just died and they recite the stanza about a how a good reputation outlives all else.

Now I'm thinking about translating the story into English. I'm debating with myself whether to keep the poetry as is, or dig up an English translation. One thing I put considerable effort into with that novella was to recreate the mode of speaking seen in the Icelandic Sagas... at least up to a certain point, since I needed the text to be easy to read. Obviously this will be lost when I translate into another language, so I kind of want to keep the poetry in Icelandic/Old Norse to keep at least SOME of that Saga feel.

I get that you're supposed to write what you love, but realistically I think vampires/ dystopias are oversaturated at this point. Extending that phenomenon to space fiction? is it it worth it to attempt something within space, assuming the project will take 1-2 years to finish (maybe the hype will have died down, or still lingering)?

,writing,"Here's what happens.

1. This is a cool idea for a character or a setting.
2. Let's brainstorm it! Come up with different characters, places, problems, conflicts.
3. Write down potential plots. All of which seem obvious, contrived and boring.
4. Change the idea slightly so it's exciting and feels fresh again.
5. Write some test scenes using the character in different P.O.Vs and tenses. Try and establish a style. See if an interesting plot comes up...
6. No strong or interesting plots are emerging, perhaps I'd be better off writing a spy thriller or a sci-fi.
7. Repeat steps 1 - 6.

,writing,"I can hear the downvotes already, but hear me out. Writing what you know can be helpful. It allows you to understand how the characters would handle the situation. But there is more to it. 

You shouldn’t dismiss works because the author didn’t write what the know. It happens to much. They say a white person cant write a story about a black family fighting for freedom from slavery. Or that a straight person can’t write about an LGBT+ person fighting against society. It’s completely wrong.

,writing,"Short bit of context:  I've been wanting to write for over 25 years (I'm 32, so I've wanted this for as long as I can remember). While I've done some small stuff for myself and messed around, I'm only now taking it seriously as something that if I don't do consistently, I won't ever really do. I've been writing for 20 straight days and I feel a significant improvement in my mentality and my self-esteem. It's incredible. Since I spent two and a half decades just thinking of story ideas, I have a ton and I chose one to start that I thought could be a short story I could send to publishers rather quickly as I prepped one of the other ideas for novel status... Well, I was wrong. The main character has stolen the show and is running with it. I'm 5,000 words in and the story has just begun. All of this was so unexpected, that I've invited a couple people to read it to see if I need to regain control and make it more concise.

However, I've also been reading Stephen King's *On Writing* and watching various MasterClass lectures to keep my motivation up. I've heard several times that it is better to ""write the first draft with the door closed"" and not let anyone read until it is finished. So I'm wondering if I need to hunker down and resist my impulses for people to take a look at it until it's all done. I know writing is a personal thing with no true way, but these professionals also know what they're talking about, right? If this were simply a short story, I could totally resist. But this may end up being a novel by the time it's all said and done. At this point its definitely a novella if I resist the urge to speed it up.

,writing,"So i'm new to writing, and i'm trying to get into it as I have a vague idea for the plot of a book that I want to write.

&amp;#x200B;

Take this example;

As with all good days, young John Woods’s started with breakfast. The day was already in full effect by the time John even began to stir, and it wasn’t of his own accord. “What do you want for breakfast John? Bacon and eggs?” His mother shouted up the stairs. Before processing what he’d just heard, the familiar aroma of bacon started seeping into the his bedroom, it didn’t seem like there was much of a choice in the matter. “Yeah sure!” he shouted sleepily, a slight pause before remembering, “Thanks!”. As John rolled out of bed, he found the pile of clothes that was left on the floor from the previous day, sniffing them to see if they were acceptable, “they’re fine.” He put them back on, stretching as he did so. Looking around his room, small beams of sunlight were coming in through the gaps in his blinds, lighting up the dust particles in the air. The currents of bacon smells swirling  through the room. Today is going to be a good day.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, i'm ok with how the setting of the scene is going (correct me if i'm wrong here)... But i find myself to just be outright stating what the character is doing, am I overthinking it and that's actually fine? Or am i missing a trick here.

The other night I was hit with a huge brainstorm wave and I realized I had an idea that may be interesting to write and would have huge potential if I could do it right. We've had stories set in fictional Wuxia settings such as Avatar TLA and we've had it based in African cultures like Children of Blood and Bone, but as someone who has always had a fascination with the steppes and Tengri culture and history, why not do a story in a similar vein of epic fantasy, but have it based in a Eurasian Mongol/Turk setting?  


The idea as is has a lot you could tackle, the rise and fall of the Khans and the factions that broke off from his death such as the Golden Horde. The rise of dogmatic rule in the West as Tengri was slowly forgotten in place of the adoption of the Islamic principles. The far north in the Altai regions of Russia, and how the Mongols disagreed with each other on a regular basis, and of course the Feud between China and Mongolia.

Twenty years later, I'm picking up a story I started writing when I was eleven. Obviously a lot has changed in terms of my perspective and skill there, but the bones of the narrative are good, which is what inspired me to have some fun with it.

Anyway, three of the characters are sisters who are all adopted from different countries, a detail that my narrator thinks about briefly a few chapters earlier.

In my eleven-year-old version, this was very on the nose and I explained the joke very explicitly (i.e. this is funny because they're not actually related).

Do you think it could be worthwhile to try and keep this cute game in as long as it's much more subtle, or should I concede that this is something that would work better in a different medium and move on?

* **Overture** means that you’re a musician.  Its literary analogue is an opening statement of the main body of text that is not immediately part of the main story.  It could be an unrelated chapter for mood-setting or a one-chapter prequel before the rest of the story occurs.
* The **introduction** can be words from either the author, publisher, or editor.  It’s the place for meta-textual notes on the rest of the work.
* A **preface** is something that I associate as being written by the author more so than publisher or editor but could be written by all three.  I think of it as less meta than the introduction.
* When a preface or introduction by the author already exists and the editor wants to add their meta-text, it is time for a **foreword**.

,writing,"Confession: I am terrible at titles. I hate them. I can't ever think of a good one. 

However, being so terrible at titles means that I have spent some time thinking about what goes into a good title. It's very tempting to just slap a ""good enough"" title on a book and tell yourself that your publisher will pick a better one, but truly you are the person best equipped to come up with a strong title. Also, sometimes your publisher doesn't change the title and then what have you done to your book, you lazy fool?

A great title *can* grab a potential buyer's attention and generate interest in your novel, so it's worth trying to come up with a great title.

**What a good title accomplishes:**

**1) Conveys genre**- The buyer should get some sense of what genre the book is in from the title. Obviously this is somewhat subjective and there is a lot of overlap and flexibility, but it's pretty clear when a title is completely missing the mark. For example, you would never call a mystery novel *Searching for Us.* Even though it has the word ""searching"" in the title, it's screams ""romance"" because of the word ""us."" You would also never call your romance ""Silent Lovers"" because that title is creepy as fuck and the use of the word ""lovers"" doesn't make it feel romantic.

**2) Sets the tone of the novel**

Funny novels need funny titles and serious novels don't get to use puns and witticisms in their titles. If your prose is dreamy and poetic, your title needs to reflect that. If your work is lean and punchy, your title needs to be as well. Your title needs to evoke the same emotions as your book does. *On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous* is a great title for a book by a poet. *Kill the Farmboy* clearly conveys humor when applied to a fantasy novel.

**3) Gives a hint to the content/topic/themes/etc.**

Your title needs to be related to the content of your book. It doesn't necessarily need to be immediately clear to the buyer/reader how the title relates to the book, especially for literary fiction, provided your title is catching their attention in some other way (#4, typically); however the more commercial your work is, the more important it is for the title to be directly related to the content of your novel. 

This is also an argument against generic phrases in titles. The more specific your title is to your work, the more it will stand out from other titles. Avoid cliches and idioms in your titles (unless there's a good reason), to keep it feeling unique.

**4) Raises a question in the buyer's mind**

This is the most important factor for me and it's the difference between a title that works and a title that's great. You want a title that makes people pick up the book to find out what it's about. This can be accomplished in a few ways:

- Unusual pairings and comparisons

- Subverting title expectations and norms

- a hint at a greater mystery

**What makes a title bad:**

**1) Misrepresents the book**

As stated above, if your title communicates the wrong genre, tone, content, etc. you are setting up false expectations for your story and your reader will be disappointed when they read your book. The title of your book is the very first promise to your reader and if you fail to deliver, they will not trust you as a writer.

**2) Generic**

There are a few things that can make a title generic. You can use generic phrases and language or you can use generic structure. I talked about generic vs. specific language already, so let's talk about structure!

- THE [NOUN] is generally fairly boring structure unless your noun is something intriguing or specific to your work. I tend to think that this type of title, in order to be successful, needs to be supported with strong cover design, but as a title removed from context, it's not a compelling structure. You can avoid this issue by adding a specific/unique/unexpected adjective.

- A/THE [BLANK] of [BLANK] and [BLANK] has been overdone at this point. There are a thousand books like this and it has become a cliche in the fantasy genre. However, coming up with fake titles using this structure is a *lot* of fun and I highly recommend it. 

- Character name as the title- Unless you are writing a book for young children (picture book or chapter book), I'm not a fan of a character's name as the title unless the character has an unexpected/unusual/compelling name that raises questions in your reader's mind. Calling your book ""Miranda"" would be boring. Calling your book ""Bertha Yamamoto"" could be compelling.

Here are some titles that I like and why I like them. This list is a reflection of my own taste (in genre and topics), so I'm not necessarily saying that all these titles are perfect and will catch everyone's attention. This is more just an exercise in ~~navel gazing~~ analyzing why specific titles might attract a reader.

**Magic for Liars** by Sarah Gailey- I truly did not even care what this book was about because that's a GREAT title. The thing that makes it work for me is that magic while being a very generic term, has good connotations. That association is subverted by pairing it with ""liars."" Also, I personally like unreliable narrators and lying as a subject, so including the word in the title told me that it would be a good fit.

**Mostly Dead Things** by Kristen Arnett- Another book that gets me on title alone. [What does it mean to be mostly dead?](https://i.imgur.com/DB9IKbE.gif) That question alone intrigues me enough to pick up a book. Also, death is another one of those topics that will get me every time.

**An Unkindness of Magicians** by Kat Howard- I haven't actually read his book yet, BUT I REMEMBER THE TITLE. The use of the word ""unkindness"" as a collective noun in the title is so fucking intriguing. I keep meaning to read this stupid book and I have no idea why I haven't done it yet.

**Midnight's Children** by Salman Rushdie- My friend told me that she heard that this book was originally called ""The Children of Midnight"" but that phrasing puts too much emphasis on ""children"" which is the less interesting word in the phrase, so swapping it around made a more compelling title.

**The Lies of Locke Lamora** by Scott Lynch- This book does the opposite of Midnight's Children. This phrasing puts ""lies"" first, which is the more interesting component of the title. I also think that pluralizing lies makes it more intriguing than just a singular lie. Everyone tells one lie, but a person that has a lot of lies is a liar and that's interesting.

**10 Minutes 38 Seconds in this Strange World** by Elif Shafak- This title works for me because of the specificity of the time. It speaks to a book with an interesting framing and makes the reader want to know why that amount of time is referenced.

**The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle** by Stuart Turton- Again, the specificity of the number is intriguing. Also, I'm always into books that reference death in the title. Also, just as with *Midnight's Children* and *The Lies of Locke Lamora*, the more interesting component of the title comes first. The number of deaths is the interesting part, not the name of the character.

**A Game of Thrones** by George R.R. Martin- This title is ICONIC. It works well for me because of the contrast of the comparison of ruling to a game. Because it's so familiar now, we don't register it as a great title, but it really is.

**The End and Other Beginnings** by Veronica Roth- Again, we have an usual comparison that raises questions in the reader's mind. Also, I personally think that it makes a vague allusion to death and the concept of the afterlife, and we've firmly established that I'll read pretty much any death book.

**Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine** by Gail Honeyman- This title works for me because the phrase ""completely fine"" clearly communicates that the titular character is not fine at all. The blatant false statement (...lie, I suppose) on the cover makes the reader want to know not only why the character is not fine, but also why the believes or wants others to believe she is fine.

During a scene which is important to one character's development and arc, the killing of an animal caught in a snare is described.

Basically I started writing my book about 2 years ago, and I had made quite a lot of progress. It is a murder mystery mixed in a sc-fi world of my making, but the problem with it is that it's been a LONG time since I actually worked on writing the book.

I'm trying to be the kind of writer that puts those little hints that once the culprit is revealed, looks like glaring indications of who the culprit was, and other such small detail oriented aspects of my book. However, having been over a year since I worked on the book, (I'm at around 60k words, on the second and final act of the book) I am just too intimidated to start writing again.

It just feels like I'm going to have a different writing style, and I'm going to contradict myself and the story plot points that I have made before. It's not that I don't want to write, I am so excited to put together the second half, as this is the part where a lot of exposition of my world comes in and you get to vibe with characters that have unique personalities, but I just can't get myself to even open the document because it feels like I'm going to ruin my previous work.

,writing,"Hi everyone,

earlier today I saw a post of someone asking about characters with no arc throughout the story, if it could be done etc. A lot of comments mentioned the flat arc, and while it's good to shine a light on it, with all due respect, I felt like it didn't answer OP question. On top of that, they were treated as interchangeable. Even if the end result is the same (character doesn't change), they are not.

On top of that, they were treated as interchangeable. Even if the end result is the same (character doesn&amp;#39;t change), they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

There are so many concepts that I missed throughout my years of writing. I don't blame the teachers; I blame myself for being complacent.

I'm now in my Junior year, and I'm telling you I'm not doing great. (I'm currently taking Freshman classes like Algebra 1) and I'm so sick of feeling dumb and nothing.

,writing,"Hello everyone, I'm trying to keep this short, but this is my first post on this subreddit, funnily enough about the first scene of my very first book, and I could use some advice. 

I'm trying to write the first interaction between my main character and a supporting character that will be of importance later. They don't speak the same language, and don't have any resources to find out what the other person is trying to say except for body language. They're both quite intelligent so they should be able to understand some things, but the problems I'm having are the following:

-It's the very first appearance of the main character and her first conversation. I want to convey that she is smart and also some basic information about her (name, maybe general appearance, etc.), without making it too obvious or making her look weird or dumb because she doesn't speak the language of the reader, but I feel like the way I'm writing it she comes across way too  cold and calculating. While I do want her to appear mysterious and cool, at the moment it feels like she's not very likable are easy to relate to. 

-How do I make the scene interesting while also describing their movements? I feel like I'm repeating words and phrases like ""she did../he pointed at.../by doing that he/she wanted to say that .. "" so it gets boring. At the same time, I am unsure how much is self explanatory and which gestures I actually have to explain to the reader.

-How far should the understanding between the characters go? Although they're both smart, I'm unsure how much they should actually be able to understand from simple body language, especially since they come from very different backgrounds which means that different gestures could mean different things to them. 
Of course the own name and naming objects by pointing at them should be fine, but what I'm thinking about is actually describing more complicated matters like going from point A to B, asking why someone is at point A in the first place, how they got there, and explaining this to the person who asked. Do you think this level of conversation would be possible, and if yes, how would you convert it into body language?

I hope someone might have an answer to at least some of the things I'm struggling with right now, and I'm also happy to answer questions if needed. I just tried to write down the problems as clear as possible without giving away too much of the storyline, but I understand if more context or information is needed.

There are too many characters in my first book that deserve screen time and their stories are not told because is from the protagonist third person POV. Is a shame really. So much potential. Many key events happened off camera and they need to be told. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing keeping me away from multiple POV is fear of a character getting more chapters in a row than others, some been a one shot chapter, or even dual chapters. For the life of me I can’t write a chapter from the villain’s POV but I could write chapters from his daughter’s POV. That would be an interesting way to develop characters who are important to the plot; through others who share the same importance. But what about characters who share the same area? What about when another POV crosses into another POV chapter? I don’t like writing the same chapter from a different POV.&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"I have some concerns that the story I'm writing may border on cultural appropriation, and I'm sure I'm not the only writer on here who has this concern. My hope is that we can use my stories premise as a case study to discuss cultural appropriation and figure out what we think is and isn't appropriate.

So the background lore for my story involves an alternate history for the origin of mankind where we move here from a dying planet to begin again. This means that a lot of cultures that exist on earth where brought from this old planet. The story mainly focuses on the native american people. I take elements of the story from Paiute folklore. For example, the people people that predated the native Americans in my story could turn into animals, the Paiute believed in a people that came before them that could turn into animals. The Thunderbird is an important creature in my story, the Thunderbird is an important creature in Paiute folklore.

So now that you have the background let me express my concerns.

1. I am an american with European ancestors. I have a lot of guilt about what my ancestors did the native american people, so it doesn't feel appropriate for me to profit off elements of their stories.
2. The Paiute have a story telling season and it is inappropriate to tell their stories out of season, and it is never appropriate to write them down. Even though I'm not telling their stories, it feels like pulling elements from them and writing them down might still cross the line.

Now that we know my story and my concern, let's make it more general. Is it ever appropriate to use elements from cultural stories when you don't belong to that culture? It must be appropriate sometimes, because sharing stories between cultures is a beautiful thing. At what point is a story so similar to a cultural story that you're basically stealing it? What role does the power gap between to cultures play in determining whether something is cultural appropriation? How can we be sensitive to other cultures and avoid cultural appropriating when we use their stories?

when you are writing a fiction, do you ever worry that what you mean don't come across? Not the type of worry regarding if the sentences are clear but concerning the whole of the story.

I just worry if I'm keeping too much of the essence to myself sometimes. Sure, there is a nice picture called the story that most would like to read ( I hope ) but it is not as alive as I would like it to be.

,writing,"A show I love is Bojack Horseman and one of the most contested characters is Diane Nguyen. Among other things, Diane’s main character flaw is hypocrisy, which is a major reason why she’s so disliked: she says women need to stick together and yet she sleeps with her ex husband while he’s dating somebody else; she says she needs her husband to be honest and yet she lies that she was somewhere else for several months just to avoid him. 

It sucks because Diane has an arguably great arc. 

I thought that Diane was the only example, but I realize that hypocrisy is a major flaw that turns people away from good characters or good points. Family guy has a speech aimed at Brian Griffin about how awful he was. But because it came from Quagmire, nobody liked it because it was hypocritical: Brian is a terrible person because he abandoned his son, despite the fact Quagmire willingly abandoned dozens of kids and Brian and his son left amicably. 

Elena Gilbert is meant to be a vanilla girl next door, so it makes her hypocrisy and the hypocrisy of the rest of the cast all the more apparent. So Elena, despite being main character, is hated by a large portion of the fanbase. 

I’ve learned after a while, but hypocrisy is one of the best and worst traits to give any character. And if it’s not, it’s kind of up there. Hypocrisy is in and of itself bad because you don’t practice what you preach, so why should I follow you if you aren’t setting an example? If your parent says to eat your vegetables or no toys, and yet they’re eating McDonald’s every night, you won’t want to eat the vegetables. 

Don’t get me wrong, it does make for an interesting character. Judge Frollo’s hypocrisy in Hunchback of Notre Dame made him a way more compelling character.

Among other things, Diane’s main character flaw is hypocrisy, which is a major reason why she’s so disliked: she says women need to stick together and yet she sleeps with her ex husband while he’s dating somebody else; she says she needs her husband to be honest and yet she lies that she was somewhere else for several months just to avoid him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sucks because Diane has an arguably great arc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that Diane was the only example, but I realize that hypocrisy is a major flaw that turns people away from good characters or good points. Family guy has a speech aimed at Brian Griffin about how awful he was. But because it came from Quagmire, nobody liked it because it was hypocritical: Brian is a terrible person because he abandoned his son, despite the fact Quagmire willingly abandoned dozens of kids and Brian and his son left amicably. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elena Gilbert is meant to be a vanilla girl next door, so it makes her hypocrisy and the hypocrisy of the rest of the cast all the more apparent. So Elena, despite being main character, is hated by a large portion of the fanbase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned after a while, but hypocrisy is one of the best and worst traits to give any character. And if it’s not, it’s kind of up there. Hypocrisy is in and of itself bad because you don’t practice what you preach, so why should I follow you if you aren’t setting an example? If your parent says to eat your vegetables or no toys, and yet they’re eating McDonald’s every night, you won’t want to eat the vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it does make for an interesting character. Judge Frollo’s hypocrisy in Hunchback of Notre Dame made him a way more compelling character. But if you want the character to be sympathized with, tread carefully. Maybe have them be called out, or work through the hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"When I began my writing journey I thought I was an outliner. I'd take an idea and figure out each character, their motivation, what their purpose was inside of the story. I'd take each scene and put introduction, climax, resolution and write my story to that, but I would never finish a story, I wouldn't even get half way.

When I figured out everything in the story I realized, for myself, that I told my story without even writing it and didn't feel the NEED to write it anymore, which of course isn't good.

So I started Pantsing, and it was wonderful. I didn't even start with a character or a plot, I just started with a question and began writing. Very quickly I had my characters, their motivations, but I didn't really know where the story was going, and that was to my benefit. I was excited to see what my characters would do, what climaxes and resolutions naturally came. And once I finished my WIP? It was a mess lmao. Loop holes, questions raised that were never answered, inconsistency. It was a disaster.

So I took my entire WIP and cut it apart into different chapters. I had the skeleton written out of the entire story now, but instead of a ten page outline it was a two hundred page first draft. I took each chapter and each act and separated them, outlined what was brought into light and what needed to be answered or removed from the story all together.

I Pantsed my way into editing, and then used my outlining knowledge to give my story that rigid structure. I originally thought that I would be an Outliner, or a Pantser, but in reality I was just both.

This might be obvious to others, but I hope that my journey through my WIP might strike a cord with others!",t2_1ywoaaf,False,,0,False,From Pantsing to Outlining,[],r/writing,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_ifi8sz,False,dark,0.93,,public,32,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,32,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1598271715.0,text,6,,,text,self.writing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I began my writing journey I thought I was an outliner. I&amp;#39;d take an idea and figure out each character, their motivation, what their purpose was inside of the story. I&amp;#39;d take each scene and put introduction, climax, resolution and write my story to that, but I would never finish a story, I wouldn&amp;#39;t even get half way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I figured out everything in the story I realized, for myself, that I told my story without even writing it and didn&amp;#39;t feel the NEED to write it anymore, which of course isn&amp;#39;t good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started Pantsing, and it was wonderful. I didn&amp;#39;t even start with a character or a plot, I just started with a question and began writing. Very quickly I had my characters, their motivations, but I didn&amp;#39;t really know where the story was going, and that was to my benefit. I was excited to see what my characters would do, what climaxes and resolutions naturally came. And once I finished my WIP? It was a mess lmao. Loop holes, questions raised that were never answered, inconsistency. It was a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took my entire WIP and cut it apart into different chapters. I had the skeleton written out of the entire story now, but instead of a ten page outline it was a two hundred page first draft.

,writing," 

TL;DR  lengthy and possibly corny post on my dangling relationship with  writing during most of my life. Advice. Do all ""real"" writers start  writing seriously since they are young? or just should I give up? how do  you know if writing is your calling?

It  is a hard question to ask. However, I feel as if every writer that  existed has started with a very obvious love for the letters, talent  which was later developed in the form of short stories, poems essays,  etc published at an early age (10-20 years old). Also, most writers  worked/are currently working as journalists or related careers, degrees  in literature or English, or any kind of job that involves, you guessed  it, a lot of WRITING! Then, there is me.

I  wanted to be a writer ever since I was 9 years old. Why? I do not know  exactly. I liked stories, but never told one, but tried to. I even sat  down to write one, showed it to my father, but he told me it was like  one of the shows on the T.V I was watching as a kid. I felt ashamed and  since I did not have any other better idea, I just left it like that. I  liked books, but did not read them (did not know where to start or what  to read) my dad had a lot of books, but they looked like complicated  books for grown ups. There were no public libraries in my town on top of  that.

I still felt that itch  however. I started reading a couple of years later, mostly out of luck. I  just grabbed what seemed an interesting tittle (Arabian Nights) and was  totally hooked. It could have been any other book, a boring one, but  no, destiny guided my hand towards the pages of that amazing story, and  soon afterwards, literature and writing was again what I wanted for me.

During  High School I did most of my reading in my desktop computer on a lot of  pdf files of ebooks. As I said, we had no libraries, nor bookshops. I  wrote some poems out of inspirations. I wrote a couple of short stories  that were asigned on an unrelated subject during classes and were  regarded as beautifully writen by my professor, I lost them, nor they  were published of course. I attempted to write a short story on a  pre-determined subject for a contest. Mine was not selected. And that  was it.

I enjoyed most of the  essay writing assignments during my courses at the University (I studied  economics). My biggest aspiration was someday be able to write articles  on politics or economics for the newspaper and get them published. I  wrote 2 articles maybe, that were sent to the newspaper but they did not  care nor published them. So, I just stopped trying. I still loved  stories and still read books, but not with that deep crazy passion of  the ""typical"" writer. Maybe I just did not think writing was possible? I  don´t know. I thought maybe that writing was a task for more  intelligent/gifted people. I thought you wrote out of inspiration!  Anyways, I kept writing the ocassional poem, but kept it for me, all  that publishing business I just did not get it, nor understand how to  ""get into"" that world.

Time has  passed, I am 28 years old. As you can see, writing as been something  that has been put under the carpet during all this time. Out of fear,  out of ignorance, out of lazyness, out of procrastination, who knows?  Yet, it has always been ""there"", like a prisioner in shackles uttering  muffled undistinctive screams of despair, because time, it seems, is  running out. Yet, maybe I do not write because I have nothing to write  about? Am I fooling myself into thinking I want to write, when in fact I  just ""kinda"" like it? But how do I explain the complete satisfaction I  have experienced when I just reread what I just produced and say ""that  is what I wanted to express and it is clearly and concisely put into  words""? How do I explain the flow state in which I inmerse, on those  rare ocassions in which I come up with a story and the hours just pass  by, like unrequested visitors?

I  would like some advice on this as it is destroying my self-steem. There  are just a couple of things that are worth doing in this world besides  expressing the complicated realities of self, yet is it for me? is it my  calling?

,writing,"I apologize in advance for the essay.

Lately, I've come to consider myself not just a person who writes, but as a writer. I hope the distinction makes sense. I'm not sure when the swap happened, but it's both comfortable and uncomfortable. I feel like it's a major part of who I am as a person now. It may be due to the long term goals and promises I've made for myself, which I've never previously done. I'm confident of my abilities—or so I thought before I recognized the anxiety. As you all know, writing is often long stretches of hard work without positive reinforcement. You almost need to be confident, to some degree, in order to see the work through to the end. I had a short story published in a journal years ago, before a long writing hiatus. That's about all the confirmation I've had, apart from beta readings done by a friend of mine in the industry (they're a published poet). Still, that's not nothing and I'm privately proud of it, though I don't tell many people.

The self-identity of ""writer"" is, on one hand, a nice thing to settle in to at thirty years old, particularly after the tumultuous period of self-doubt and shifting values experienced by most of us in our teens and twenties. On the other hand, being ""a writer"" makes me feel anxious. I don't get anxious *while* writing, only *about* writing; perhaps not even that, but about allowing myself to identify as a writer. Maybe it's impostor syndrome. The only palliative avenue I've found for the feeling is, simply, to make myself write. I *have* to write every day, even if it's only a few hundred words.

I know I am jumping the gun a little bit in my own writing process, but my mind has been all aflutter with wanting to come up with a Pen Name.

My name is very common and ordinary. So, I have been trying to sort out some potential pen names for when my novel is complete. As I want to start to frame myself as viewing this as a second name instead of be caught off guard if I do have successes. 

I have plans to either keep my first name the same, and change my last name. Or, go by my middle initial and last name. Would you be more likely to pick up a novel by B. Rogers (example) or Amanda Crispi (example)? Do you even decide if you want to pick up a novel by the author's name? If the author has a long name do you dislike the length/difficulty in pronunciation? Am I thinking too much into it?

,writing,"I always liked the very simple, straightforward style of children's books, to me a really good piece of kidlit can be as direct and earnest and moving as a Bresson film.

,writing,"I've written about 5 novels now and I've noticed an arc I go through. I get excited about an idea at first, I start prepping for it and outlining it, and then i go into writing it.

And for the first bit I'm really excited about it. I need to get this story down, and every scene brings interesting information and drama to give to the reader. By the middle I'm still liking the idea and i get into a nice groove where i seem to be writing at a good clip and everything seems to be running fine.

But then by 3/4 of the way through i start to doubt myself. Scenes begin to shorten and i get worried whether the novel will be big enough, i feel that the feelings within the scenes aren't doing what i want them to do. I begin to doubt whether the scenes before are actually any good as well. Eventually writing becomes a bit of a grind, until i limp over the finishing line and i just want to chuck away the novel and start another one.

This happens EVERY SINGLE TIME WITH EVERY SINGLE NOVEL! 

Why can i not ever seem to like my books near the end? Why do i always feel there is problems that I can't seem to get over? And i feel this os definitely affecting me, because i get this at the end it means i never actually get out there with my book. I'm stopping myself from publishing...and i think i always will because of this feeling.

I get excited about an idea at first, I start prepping for it and outlining it, and then i go into writing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the first bit I&amp;#39;m really excited about it. I need to get this story down, and every scene brings interesting information and drama to give to the reader. By the middle I&amp;#39;m still liking the idea and i get into a nice groove where i seem to be writing at a good clip and everything seems to be running fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then by 3/4 of the way through i start to doubt myself. Scenes begin to shorten and i get worried whether the novel will be big enough, i feel that the feelings within the scenes aren&amp;#39;t doing what i want them to do. I begin to doubt whether the scenes before are actually any good as well. Eventually writing becomes a bit of a grind, until i limp over the finishing line and i just want to chuck away the novel and start another one.&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"I have a question. At or toward the end of all fantasy series/ books there is a point in time where the hero is stuck in some situation, that makes it look hopeless as if they’re they going to lose the final battle, not save the girl, overcome the final obstacle whatever it is, basically they aren’t going to make it. 


I understand this is obviously because if the hero just ran in and saved the day instantly there would be no suspense, and the end would be boring, and the author would have wasted however long it took to build this whole epic adventures climax up for nothing because the end would be flat. 



During this period in MOST fantasy adventure books I’ve read, specifically series, there are flashes around between the main character/ group and other people around the setting that are doing other things to set up for the last fight. These people, although they usually have some significant role, are usually sub characters (idk what the proper term is, secondary characters or whatever) and these things they’re doing to set up, although they may provide some background or clarity on what’s going on in the world at the time, are usually extremely boring. And I often find my self irritated that my focus is being brought away from the main characters and I have to dredge through some bland alternative plot to get back to the goodies and excitement going on with the main guy/s or girl/s. 



Here is my question: is this flipping back and forth USUALLY just to clean up some last character development , is it supposed to be more of a suspense tool? To keep you wanting to get back to the main character? And to keep the story from ending too quickly? Are there other reasons I don’t see? 



I just find myself feeling less in suspense, then irritated because my sense of suspense is somewhat ruined by moving away from the characters that the suspense is built around. Almost like my immersion is being broken by having to switch away from the main story line. I feel like this happens in to many books for it not to be some sort of agreed upon writing technique that is used for a specific reason, and that’s why I wanted to come to you guys.


TL;DR: why do people break my immersion by swapping story lines away from the main characters right in their moment of greatest need.

It kind of bums me out considering that I've been mapping my work out over five years and for me to just get bored with it.

,writing,"I was responding to yet another post here in r/writing asking how to flesh out characters, and I came up with a way to think about characters that might be helpful to other writers with fleshing out their characters.

**Puppets vs Kittens**

A puppet is just you, your brain, your personality, your everything, pretending to speak out of your hand. It doesn't have a personality. It isn't real. It's just a sock you pulled over your hand, and now you get to say your words through a sock.

The characters created by newer writers are often just puppets, and are simply standing in, mouthing the lines the writer tells them to say. They are flat, lifeless, and don't feel ""real"" or ""exciting"" or if you have a bunch of different characters they can all feel very similar, because they are all using the same source: they are just a proxy for YOU, the writer.

Kittens, on the other hand, are impossible to keep in one place. They are constantly trying to escape, explore, get out of their box, and see the world. They are persistent, lively, and don't follow your orders or direction very well.

You know you have an excellent grasp on your character when you are writing a scene and they surprise you. They do something unexpected. You think you are writing a love scene, and suddenly she grabs a sword from the wall, swings out the window on the curtain, and makes her escape into the night.

""Oh shit,"" you think. ""That wasn't supposed to happen!""

Now your mind is spinning... she didn't make love to the prince, like she was SUPPOSED to do, and now she's outside... at night... with a sword... and he's laying in bed... doing *WHAT!?!?* 

Now BOTH characters have gotten far more interesting. Why? Because they aren't pale shadows of YOU, they are exerting their own personalities and stretching their newfound powers. They've leaped off the screen into the movie theater, and are looking around and thinking, ""Ooh! This is cool...!"" *(Ever seen Woody Allen's, ""Purple Rose of Cairo""?)*

**Breed Kittens. Dump the Puppets.**

Your characters should be kittens. They should be rambunctious and somewhat unpredictable. It is your job as the writer to expose them to scenes and environments and other characters that they will leverage to move the story forward in their own way.

**Pantsing vs Planning**

This inevitably will bring up the arguments between ""pantsing it"" - writing without a clear plan, and just going by the seat of your pants - or planning out your piece, whether it is cue cards or an outline or however you like to plan your storyline.

""Aren't you just advocating for pantsing it all the time?"" I hear you ask.

No.

What I have found useful is to pants it with a new character to flesh out who they are and what they are like. Make up a scene, put them in it, and see what they do. No plan. No goal. Just let the kitten loose and see what happens.

Do this two or three times for this character, putting them into different types of scenes... a love scene... a chase scene... a quiet moment of reflection... and you'll have a strong feeling for the character of the character (har har), and what kind of kitten you have raised.

Then, build your box: go to your story outline or plan, and pick a scene. Why is this scene important to the story? Who is in it? Why is each of them there? What does each character want to achieve from this scene before it ends? And what happens when one of more of them do not get the outcome they want?

Then put your kittens into the box you have built and let each of them explore and roam and try to get out of the box. (Or fall asleep. Or go get a bite to eat. Or attack another kitten.)

**This sounds hard.**

If this sounds hard, or like a lot of work, or you don't think your characters will do anything when you let them loose, then you know you don't have good characters yet. They are just puppets so far, and have no individual life to them. And nobody wants to read a puppet reciting your words... they wanna see a box full of kittens, all full of energy and vim and vigor and trying to explore and get out and have an impact on the world.

Pick any character you have. Put them in a scene they would never be in - a Chicago cop in a 14th century castle in England, or a teenage computer programmer on a merchant marine ship - and see what happens. Write two or three pages.

Did your character surprise you? Did they do something unexpected?

If so, you have raised a kitten, and have an interesting character for your story.

If not, give the character a prejudice or a handicap or a belief that you don't personally hold. Try again. Iterate on the character until something sparks in them, and you can see how they'd react in ANY situation. Then try to let the kitten loose again, and see what they do.

Building interesting characters that hold the reader's attention and make me want to turn the page to see what they do next, is key to having stories that engage people and make them want to keep reading.

A good character - a crazy kitten - will help you make your story move forward, and make writing much more fun. Your story may not go where you were planning originally, but being surprised by your characters and having to corral the little bastards so they tell the story you want to tell makes a great story that readers can engage with.

They are flat, lifeless, and don&amp;#39;t feel &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;exciting&amp;quot; or if you have a bunch of different characters they can all feel very similar, because they are all using the same source: they are just a proxy for YOU, the writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kittens, on the other hand, are impossible to keep in one place. They are constantly trying to escape, explore, get out of their box, and see the world. They are persistent, lively, and don&amp;#39;t follow your orders or direction very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know you have an excellent grasp on your character when you are writing a scene and they surprise you. They do something unexpected. You think you are writing a love scene, and suddenly she grabs a sword from the wall, swings out the window on the curtain, and makes her escape into the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh shit,&amp;quot; you think. &amp;quot;That wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to happen!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your mind is spinning... she didn&amp;#39;t make love to the prince, like she was SUPPOSED to do, and now she&amp;#39;s outside... at night... with a sword... and he&amp;#39;s laying in bed... doing &lt;em&gt;WHAT!?!?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now BOTH characters have gotten far more interesting. Why? Because they aren&amp;#39;t pale shadows of YOU, they are exerting their own personalities and stretching their newfound powers. They&amp;#39;ve leaped off the screen into the movie theater, and are looking around and thinking, &amp;quot;Ooh! This is cool...!&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;(Ever seen Woody Allen&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;Purple Rose of Cairo&amp;quot;?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breed Kittens. Dump the Puppets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your characters should be kittens. They should be rambunctious and somewhat unpredictable. It is your job as the writer to expose them to scenes and environments and other characters that they will leverage to move the story forward in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pantsing vs Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inevitably will bring up the arguments between &amp;quot;pantsing it&amp;quot; - writing without a clear plan, and just going by the seat of your pants - or planning out your piece, whether it is cue cards or an outline or however you like to plan your storyline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aren&amp;#39;t you just advocating for pantsing it all the time?&amp;quot; I hear you ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have found useful is to pants it with a new character to flesh out who they are and what they are like. Make up a scene, put them in it, and see what they do. No plan. No goal. Just let the kitten loose and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do this two or three times for this character, putting them into different types of scenes... a love scene... a chase scene... a quiet moment of reflection... and you&amp;#39;ll have a strong feeling for the character of the character (har har), and what kind of kitten you have raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, build your box: go to your story outline or plan, and pick a scene. Why is this scene important to the story? Who is in it? Why is each of them there? What does each character want to achieve from this scene before it ends? And what happens when one of more of them do not get the outcome they want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then put your kittens into the box you have built and let each of them explore and roam and try to get out of the box. (Or fall asleep. Or go get a bite to eat. Or attack another kitten.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This sounds hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds hard, or like a lot of work, or you don&amp;#39;t think your characters will do anything when you let them loose, then you know you don&amp;#39;t have good characters yet. They are just puppets so far, and have no individual life to them. And nobody wants to read a puppet reciting your words... they wanna see a box full of kittens, all full of energy and vim and vigor and trying to explore and get out and have an impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick any character you have. Put them in a scene they would never be in - a Chicago cop in a 14th century castle in England, or a teenage computer programmer on a merchant marine ship - and see what happens. Write two or three pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did your character surprise you? Did they do something unexpected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, you have raised a kitten, and have an interesting character for your story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, give the character a prejudice or a handicap or a belief that you don&amp;#39;t personally hold. Try again. Iterate on the character until something sparks in them, and you can see how they&amp;#39;d react in ANY situation. Then try to let the kitten loose again, and see what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building interesting characters that hold the reader&amp;#39;s attention and make me want to turn the page to see what they do next, is key to having stories that engage people and make them want to keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good character - a crazy kitten - will help you make your story move forward, and make writing much more fun. Your story may not go where you were planning originally, but being surprised by your characters and having to corral the little bastards so they tell the story you want to tell makes a great story that readers can engage with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps some people write better characters! Please comment if you have more ideas for how to draw out interesting characters!!&lt;/p&gt;

,writing,"A very common scenario I see writers encounter is running into a challenge that they can't immediately remedy with a potion. 

For instance:

* **Word count**, based on your outline, is too long, but there's no way to cut it down.
* Writing third person but can't seem to **express the emotions** of a character--do I stop writing and switch to first person?
* Or vice versa, writing in first person, but can't seem to express emotions or **events happening outside** of the MC.
* **Have too many POVs**, but all of them serve a purpose. 

Often, in these situations, I find that writers embrace one of two routes:

* Accept the flaw and keep writing. (\**Gives you intense stare while sipping my pumpkin cream cold brew*\*)
* Get rid of whatever is causing the flaw and not face it. (\**Prepares to order another cold brew*\*)

And this **makes sense**. 

Psychologically, we strive to follow the path of *least resistance*. If you see two roads, one full of people leading to your favorite restaurant, and one completely empty leading to your second favorite restaurant--**which one do you pick**?

Most likely, in the moment, the one of least resistance--even if you have to give up a better payoff.

However, there's another, **conflicting** psychological mechanism. (I mean, aren't there always?)

Game developers want all the best toys when making their games. The best graphics. The best mechanics. The biggest budget. The biggest team. They **don't want any challenge** standing in their way from making the best  game.

Yet, the lead of the project understands a different reality. 

When giving creative people a limitation--like smaller budget--it requires the team to think outside the game cartridge and face the problem *creatively*. Often leading to a much better video game experience. And yes, I do mean we should start cutting of hands to make creating games ***that*** much more challenging.

Writing is no different, though. 

When faced with a challenge, it forces us to think creatively to solve it.

However, because writing is a solo-project, and we're programmed to travel the road with least resistance, it can be hard to do that. 

So, I urge my fellow writers to embrace the challenge. 

**Don't run from it.**

For instance, large word counts.

Yes, your story is *vast* and **amazing** and on ***levels beyond belief***. It just needs that 120k word count to tell it. 

But does it really? 

That emotional chapter you have--that badass action chapter. What if you combined them? 

What if you somehow, creatively, made that emotional chapter work with the action chapter, turning it into something far greater than the sum of its parts (**gestalt theory**)? 

Try it out. Use that same philosophy for other chapters. If you took your vast story and combined the chapters, turning it into an 85k word novel, you'll be blown away with how deep and compelling the entire read will be--compared to a long, drawn out story.

When you hit a roadblock, take a moment to sit back and think through how to work within that limitation, rather than get rid of it. 

You may find that your story transforms to a whole new level.",t2_7aiqeahz,False,,0,False,Stop Running From a Challenge,[],r/writing,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_immemb,False,dark,0.95,,public,201,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,201,,False,self,1599267878.0,,[],{},,True,,1599275981.0,text,6,,,text,self.writing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very common scenario I see writers encounter is running into a challenge that they can&amp;#39;t immediately remedy with a potion. &lt;/p&gt;
