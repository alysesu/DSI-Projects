il7508,At the mid point of my novel and my brain wants to start a new project,"Why?????? Why can’t I just finish the first draft of this novel. I was confident and felt I had a good flow and now I’m at a point where I need to wrap up the plot and finish the damn thing and then a new idea pops in my head for a completely different story. So, I wrote it down and left it alone and came back to my novel that I want to finish. But all I can think about is this other story. 

When this happens, do you find it helps to start a new project and come back to the old one? Maybe I’ve been so fixated on the story at hand that I’m having doubts and getting bored with it? I know others have mentioned this mid story slump but just wondering what helps other writers push through.",MStrobel22,169,48,1599054620.0,2020-09-02 13:50:20
ikwybw,Sometimes the genre picks you instead.,"I’ve spent several years now drafting dozens of story ideas, but only getting around 30-40 pages in before I start to hate the storyline and the characters and every part of it. I end up with all of these sad drafts on my computer with no end in sight. I had always assumed I would be successful in writing about things I personally experience - coming of age type pieces, finding love and romance, day to day hardships and life, etc. but I could never stick with an idea long enough to enjoy it. I struggled coming up with good ideas that I hadn’t seen a hundred times before, and I never felt like I saw myself in my writing. I just saw me, trying to copy the success of another writer telling myself “I should be good at this too”.

Getting into the Halloween spirit (because what else are you gonna do nowadays), I found a creepy instrumental playlist to listen to while I decorated the house and my mind went wild with ideas and plots and characters. I always assumed my darker writing in high school was just angsty teenage rebellion, but I always wrote better when I wrote uncomfortable, scary stuff - that’s what I’m good at. I’m not good at writing about slow burning young adult love or soul searching. I’m good at writing about the scary side of life, the unknown, and I never fully dove into that side of my creativity.

So moral of the story, if you’ve been struggling to put a piece together or find a storyline idea you enjoy, maybe it’s time to take a dip in different genre waters. Good luck!",alexnicoleruss,808,54,1599008268.0,2020-09-02 00:57:48
il8f4p,How to improve my Story Writing skills when starting from Step 0,"Hello, I'm 21 years old and I want to get into writing.  
I've made some bad decisions over the years and suffered from a few addictions which I am currently trying to beat. Before my life took a turn for the worst I remembered I used to enjoy reading Fantasy novels and even doing creative writing (When I was age 16 and under). I've tried writing but it's honestly trash, my self at 16 years old could do better than what I can produce now.

  
What steps can I take to improve? After a google search, I've seen some people suggest Reading more. So currently I am reading ""American Gods"" by Neil Gaiman and it is amazing so far but I'm honestly skeptical that I can improve from just reading other's works.

So initially, I saw this character as a chill ""neutral good"" type, someone who tried to be polite to everyone and had a reasonably strong moral compass, but then I realized I've written characters like that in the past and I wanna try something different.

I don't want the character to be proudly evil or proudly amoral or something without going through character dev to become better, but I genuinely don't know if it's possible for a ""decent"" person - someone who's reasonably sensitive/thoughtful and kind/polite to others - to have significant flaws and have to develop into a better person.

ilaack,Epistolary novel What's the best way to start one,"Quick rundown on what an  Epistolary novel is,  

&gt;An **epistolary novel** is a [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel) written as a series of documents. The usual form is [letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_(message)), although [diary entries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary), [newspaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper) clippings and other documents are sometimes used. Recently, electronic ""documents"" such as recordings and radio, [blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogs), and [e-mails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mails) have also come into use. The word [*epistolary*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epistolary) is derived from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) word ἐπιστολή *epistolē*, meaning a letter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The epistolary form can add greater [realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)) to a story, because it mimics the workings of real life. It is thus able to demonstrate differing points of view without recourse to the device of an [omniscient narrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscient_narrator). An important strategic device in the epistolary novel for creating the impression of authenticity of the letters is the fictional editor.

Has anyone here tackled this form of storytelling before? I have some ideas, they just seem juvenile or naive any suggestions are welcomed.",The_Contingency_Man,0,2,1599064771.0,2020-09-02 16:39:31

To help him throughout the journey, he adopts another name to help keep his identity hidden and he is referred by his new name throughout the rest of the story (with it being used every now and then by himself or other characters).


The name change happens pretty early on and so I just wanted some opinions and advice on whether introducing the character with one name (his real one) and then changing it to another one might be a bit confusing or whether the reader will adapt pretty easily to it.

ikbvhi,I can’t make myself read through an editing buddy’s draft—how do I tell them?,"This is my first attempt at finding a writing buddy on a matching website for writers. Someone contacted me, and after talking a bit she sent me the draft of a novella. Edit: the website is CritiqueMatch.com

I haven’t sent anything to her for editing, but I thought I’d look through the draft. I told her I’d get through it in two weeks. 

I’m about 1/5 of the way into the novella, and while the story and writing aren’t terrible, I simply can’t make myself read anymore. The heroine is INSUFFERABLE, simply unreasonable and inhumanly annoying, and the plot and other elements simply aren’t interesting enough for me to put up with her. 

I honestly don’t want to read this draft anymore. I feel like I’m wasting my time, and it’s such a drag. 

How on earth do I get myself out of this? Do I tell her right out that the heroine is awful? But I haven’t read through the rest of the draft, and I really don’t want to, so it feels irresponsible. 

I’ve been contemplating telling her something came up in my real life and just leaving her with the edits on 1/5 of the draft. I’d finish with a nice and cushioned note about how the heroine is sort of annoying. Is that okay? 

I know as a writer myself I’d prefer it if the reader told me the absolute truth, but I can’t bring myself to tell her what I really think, especially as I don’t intend to finish reading the draft.

ikr0m8,Writing now feels juvenile to me?,"After two long years of neglecting the craft, I finally sat down to try and write some stories. I started small, trying short descriptions, flash stories, free form poetry, etc. 

Every single time I wrote, I felt absolutely juvenile. I mean, the writing wasn’t awful, but I felt like a child. I felt silly and useless and continuously questioned what I was doing and why I was doing it. If someone looked over my shoulder at my computer or notebook I’d hurriedly hide the evidence of my writing (even though it wasn’t NSFW or bad or anything) and struggled with feelings of deep shame as though what I was doing was ridiculous and stupid. 

This has been absolutely heartbreaking for me because the one thing that has always kept me going, working, saving money, etc, was that I was going to get to college and get a degree in English Literature or something and teach writing at a college and get some work published and live at least some of my dream. Even when I wasn’t writing because I was working so much, I told myself that it would all be okay because I’d train myself to use the pen again and set myself back on the right track. 

Now that feels impossible. How can I do any of that, how can I write at all if I feel like the very action is childish and useless?

ikh9sr,My hero is unattractive - did I do the wrong thing?,"As a gentleman of limited visual appeal, I got fed up reading about handsome men getting off with gorgeous women - I can't relate to that. So I wrote an epic (my description) crime thriller adventure novel where my hero was a really unattractive guy who couldn't get a girl to save his life but was sucked into a situation where he found himself trying to save the life of a pretty girl, and the two of them have to work together to bring a murderer to justice. I thought the dynamic between them would be interesting, and was really pleased how the book turned out. 

But now I'm thinking people want escapism when they read - they want to read about a strong handsome protagonist because they can imagine themselves being that person and it makes them feel better. Being reminded of your own deficiencies by reading about a weedy plain guy and all the problems he has because of his looks, just trying to do his best, is depressing. Or is it? Don't people need someone they can empathise with sometimes? Surely there is a market out there of ugly guys like me who will really buy into my character and appreciate the realism?

In a story, what would be the best way to represent the word OK?  I typically use it as ""okay"" unless the a piece of dialogue begins with okay, in which case I use ""OK"".  

For example:

I felt okay after she told me the truth.

""OK, meet me there at three.""

My questions:

1. Would it have been acceptable to also write: I felt OK after she told me the truth.  And, ""Okay, meet me there at three?""  
2. If ""okay/OK"" is used multiple times in a story, should it be kept consistent... meaning ""okay"" only or ""OK"" only?",LXL79,4,17,1598990053.0,2020-09-01 19:54:13

iky2tk,LF Writing Advice on Quality vs Quantity,"It's very well-known that Stephen King writes 10 pages a day, but there's something I don't really get. Isn't it always quality over quantity?

To use a metaphor: If I go to the gym and do fifty squats, but for those squats - if my legs are too close, my knees goes way over my toes, and my back isn't straight - I'm just gonna do fifty shi\*\*y squats. Instead of doing that, any trainer would say it is much better to do, say, ten correct squats then to do fifty squats without the correct form.

So, for writing, wouldn't it make more sense to, I don't know the exact numbers and it probably varies, but, for the sake of simplicity and general example, if Stephen King wrote 10 pages in the span of 4 hours, and someone else wrote 3 pages in the span of 4 hours - wouldn't it stand, assuming both are of equal level professionally and career-wise, that the person who wrote the 3 pages is of higher quality and thus better than the 10 pages?

ikforv,What keeps readers turning pages?,"I've had this on my mind for ages. Here are some possible clues.

Pace? Someone mentioned *Tarzan of the Apes* over on r/books a little while ago, and it got me thinking about the pleasant experience I had reading that book. Despite it having what I feel is a very slow pace, Burroughs managed to draw me in and keep me reading. So fast pace may not be the key to keepin' 'em turning pages.

Danger and Stakes? Stories that can somehow quickly get us to understand the stakes at hand may keep us reading. On the other hand, without character building, the stakes don't mean much; why does it matter if a character I don't care about yet is in danger?

Reading Level? If a book is supposed to be, say, for Young Adults, and you load it up with college-level words, those may serve as ""speed bumps"" for your readers and lead them to put the book down.

Building curiosity? Both with movies and books, there are storytellers who get a lot of flack for being hacks. But one thing they do well, which covers a multitude of their sins, is build curiosity.

I'll briefly mention two: Dan Brown and J.J. Abrams.

Dan Brown gets clowned by more ""serious"" writers for his prose, his reuse of themes, and, well, lots of stuff. But damned if he isn't good at building curiosity. In *The DaVinci Code,* when Robert Langdon's hotel room door gets knocked on late in evening, and he has his coat put on him and is whisked into the night, you're curious. When we're ""shown"" the polaroid of the old man, naked on the floor, we're hooked -- why is the man in the Vitruvian pose? We're turning pages.

J.J. gets joked on for his ""Mystery Box"" comments. But, on paper at least, ""mystery boxes"" are a damned good idea: begin to open up something on the first few pages that the audience gets curious to peek into. So, in *The Force Awakens*, our first few shots of Rey are as a masked figure scavenging around a crashed Star Destoyer. Who is this man or woman? And why is there a crashed Star Destroyer?

In *Cloverfield*, not a lot of time is wasted before, boom, the Statue of Liberty's head gets knocked off. What the hell is going on? Is this a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or what? Everybody out to the street. Now we're running. What are the cops shooting machine guns at? Curiosity galore.

Of course, Abrams is also good at opening mystery boxes (Who are Rey's parents? Where'd Luke's lightsaber come from?) that he does a dogshit job of closing.

All of which makes me suspect that you can be weak in quite a few areas of writing (plotting, dialogue) but if you can succeed at creating curiosity, you can succeed at writing.

ikiqtb,"I'm at a crossroads with what to do next, and I'd appreciate some advice.","Hey all,

To cut to the chase: I don't know whether or not I should give up on my first book.

I've spent several years writing and re-writing and editing it, and I recently felt that it was finally time to reach out to find an agent. Whenever I think about the book during my daily life, I feel good about it. Looking through it for any last minute edits, I think it looks fine. However, as soon as I sit down to write some query letters, it's like I finally see the book for what it truly is. I think of so many different parts that others would probably see as being terribly written, sections that I think are fine only hours before, and that number seems to grow whenever I even think about finding an agent.

However, this isn't the biggest part of the problem. I have dozens of other ideas for novels, some of which I have almost the entire story outlined and am very eager to start on, but I feel that I shouldn't even begin to write them without publishing the first book first.

I still care about my first book. I like the characters and the world, but I just feel so torn.

So, my question is this: Should I continue working on my first book? Do I try to nail down every last section or story beat that feels wrong, when that number seems to be never ending? Or, should I shelve it for now, and move on to a fresh start, where I can apply what I learned from all those mistakes?

ikr9xo,"On Guilt Flags: character sympathy and punishment (usually) has to be logical and proportionate, lest readers feel something's off","Let's talk about guilt flags. What is a guilt flag? A term I made up a few days ago, but fundamentally a concept that's been around for a very long time and has often been discussed (there's probably already a term for this, but I haven't found it). 

**A guilt flag is an event or trait that results in a character losing sympathy, increasing feelings of distrust, disdain, vengefulness, antipathy, schadenfreude, and annoyance, usually coupled with a desire for punishment.** In media, guilt flags are often an abstract McGuffin used to tell a guilt trip story— i.e. a character(s) does something wrong and seeks forgiveness, to varying degrees of success. Sometimes, the story doesn't focus on the direct effects of the guilt flag itself, but carrying it does color the character in some way, giving them some extra flavor to their personality (unless the guilt flag *is* their personality, in which case they're probably a fairly flat character).

There are three central focal points: the Carrier, the Victim, and the Audience. 

The Carrier is the one who carries the guilt flag, the guilty party in other words. Their arc revolves around this guilt flag; if they ignore it, the Audience (in-universe and readers) will constantly question why they face no retribution unless that's just a common thing in the story's universe. 

The Victim is the one against whom the Carrier acted against or directly affected. This one is the most variable. 

The Audience is everyone else, whether fellow characters in universe or readers/viewers. An In-Universe Audience will likely shame, guilt, arrest, and/or try to kill the Carrier depending on the severity of what they've done. The Readers usually won't have a say in this, but they ultimately determine whether atonement has occurred and forgiveness is merited.

The typical arc of a guilt trip storyline can be summed up as ""each of these four archetypes forgiving the Carrier."" For a 'successful' arc, they all have to generally decide that the Carrier's been sufficiently punished and/or rehabilitated. If one of them doesn't, then the Carrier becomes either a Karma Houdini or a complete Woobie. It might also affect the story and characters in various ways.

If the Victim and the two Audiences forgive the Carrier but the Carrier themselves can never forgive themselves, that might lead to self-hatred and depression on their part— but also melodrama and self-pity in others' eyes. If only the Carrier decides they've suffered enough (or even refuses to feel remorse or guilt at all), they'll probably be seen as narcissistic, sociopathic, annoying, and deeply in need of being smacked down— the longer said smackdown is delayed, the more gratifying it becomes when it happens. The the Carrier and the Victim return to good terms and the In-Universe Audience also accepts this conclusion but the Reader Audience thinks the Carrier got off too light, they've chosen their new Scrappy and this character will always be scrutinized. If only the Victim refuses to forgive or at least accept atonement, *they* might be seen as too harsh and intolerant, *especially* if the Readers don't agree with them to boot.

And so on and so forth.

***Many factors affect the size of the guilt flag— the severity of the Carrier's actions (if there are any actions at all), who the Carrier is, and the context of their actions are the biggest ones coming to mind.***

In any children's show, guilt flags are used often to teach a lesson. Character A will do something that inconveniences or annoys Character B, so B tries getting back at A in a way that proves disproportionate is a fairly common plot, but sometimes B gets back at A in a way that *is* proportionate and satisfying— and sometimes, A is guilty over doing what they did and, rather than B trying to get back at them, A instead spends the episode trying to make it up to them to get rid of the guilt flag. 

Let's imagine Adam deliberately ate a cookie meant for Beatrice. That's a very small guilt flag in 99% of situations. Even in an over-the-top story, the worst we'd expect is that Adam and Beatrice aren't friends for a day. Imagine if Beatrice decided to shoot Adam in the head, and then told police, ""He ate my cookie."" Unless this is a cynical black comedy or set up to some psychological horror, *that's an atrociously disproportionate reaction.* Adam's action did *not* warrant death. What he did was a tiny bit assholish, but outside nerd kvltvre cynics and psychopaths who go out of their way to be as misanthropic and ironic as possible, Beatrice just lost audience sympathy overwhelmingly. 

Think ""Code of Hammurabi"": an eye for an eye. The closer to equivalency you get, the more justified and satisfying the reaction is. The more disproportionate (one way or the other), the more frustrating it gets. Of course, the Carrier can face *slightly* more disproportionate retribution and still see audience schadenfreude against them— if they pluck an eye, both of their eyes can be taken out and people won't feel too sorry for them. If they're blinded as well as burned in acid and crucified, then yeah, the audience is going to start saying, ""This is going way too far.""

Things get even more harrowing for Beatrice if Adam is a child. In most cultures, children are seen as inherently more innocent, and therefore we let them get away with more than we would older teenagers and adults. That only goes so far and up to a certain level of actions, but generally Adam's actions won't evoke such extreme antipathy if he's 8 years old and Beatrice is an adult. If it's the opposite— Adam is an adult and Beatrice is a child— he might get *more* antipathy than otherwise because he just made a child upset. And that's really just the start of how much who a character is can affect a guilt flag.

To show what I mean by *context* changing everything, the guilt flag changes completely if Adam is a fascistic aristocrat who constantly and sadistically torments Beatrice— an impoverished, mentally broken vagrant whose only joy in life is getting this cookie. The sheer schadenfreude of seeing Adam shot in the face means that the Audience places unto Beatrice no guilt flag or a very small one at most (barring those types who think Adam's completely in the right). 

#But let's say it's not a cookie but rather murder. 

This time, it's just a normal suburban neighborhood and Adam murders Beatrice. He then spends the rest of the story wracked by guilt and remorse over what he's done. The question becomes ""does he ever attain forgiveness and atonement?"" The answer is *deeply* complicated. More optimistic stories will say that him just being really, really sorry will eventually lead to reconciliation. More pessimistic and realistic ones will point out that no, there are some things he can't quite overcome. 

The most optimal situation in any guilt trip story is of the Carrier completely losing their guilt flag. They can freely associate with the Victim as though nothing can happened.

On principle, that's not possible with anything where the Carrier has killed or permanently mentally crippled the Victim. So even if the Carrier has all but become Jesus Christ in the eyes of the audience, there will always be at least *one* character to which they are unable to lose their guilt flag. 

To some in the Audience, taking another's life is an unforgivable guilt. There is no possible path to redemption other than death. But for others, forgiving murder or manslaughter is as simple as begging forgiveness or doing a few good deeds. And depending on the story, genocidal maniacs can become white-hearted heroes in everyone's eyes within a few arcs just because they decided to rescue a puppy and kept acting from there.

Sometimes, one of the chief Victims might be the Carrier themselves. This is especially common in what I call ""Original Sin"" guilt trips. These being tales where the Carrier is guilty because of *who* they are rather than what they've done. Because of the circumstances of their birth, their relations, their friends, and/or some other trait fundamental to who they are, they are cast as guilty and in need of redemption— if possible. Of course, the actual Victim remains those who were wronged by the Carrier's relations; they just blame the chosen Carrier and punish them as well.

This is an easy one with which an author can evoke audience sympathy for the Carrier/Victim because they're ""guilty"" of something they did not do. It's also easy to mess up because the (reader) Audience may get constantly frustrated by them trying to redeem themselves if the characters' situation never improves and they themselves are not disagreeable or unlikable. Indeed, it runs the risk of invoking the trope of ""Then Let Me Be Evil""— if the Victim and In-Universe Audience decides that a character born with a guilt flag or forced to carry one *cannot be redeemed* for whatever reason, then for many Readers, that justifies them living up to the flag and actually gaining a reason to carry it. Punishing a character for breaking only invokes frustration (up to a point).

(Just to mention it: being framed or scapegoated means that the Carrier is carrying a false guilt flag; these stories are usually about them proving they're not guilty or taking the fall for someone else).

It does have to be stressed that the Carrier does *not* have to feel remorse or want to atone for their actions, nor does the Victim or Audience ever have to forgive them. Indeed, the Victim can forgive the Carrier, but the Audience may not. Likewise, the Victim may never forgive the Carrier, but the Audience may want to coddle and protect them. 

_______________

*My personal favorite* is a guilt flag somewhere between a moderate-sized one (e.g. ""Adam broke Beatrice's arm and made her miss a big dance"") and an ""unforgivable"" one (e.g. ""Adam sexually tortured and murdered Beatrice""), one where a character's redemption is not guaranteed but also not impossible; the Victim is still alive &amp; possibly even quite well and the Carrier experiences deep, extreme remorse. But simply feeling remorse and perhaps even acting on said remorse does not change what is done. The Victim ultimately gets to decide what redemption looks like. For the Audience however, the Carrier has to basically be thoroughly humiliated and almost broken down before they can be forgiven (and they might not be forgiven after all that)— but, critically, the Audience also has to feel that there's still a red line that shouldn't be crossed. Actually *killing them* or torturing them or something of that caliber will quickly evaporate negative feelings towards them. That's too harsh. If the Victim was traumatized, for example, then even if the Carrier is remorseful, the Audiences will usually tolerate them traumatizing the Carrier back. But if the Victim actively tries to, say, tie them up into their basement and torture them or actively drive them to suicide, they will have completely lost sympathy and Readers especially will feel no pity in someone coming in and putting two between the eyes. As a result, there's actual nuance; you can't take the easy way out, and there *are* several paths forward. Not all optimal, but not all negative either.


____________________


#One of the big themes of any guilt-based story is that of *consequences*. If there are no consequences, what's even the point?

Any good one should have lasting consequences: trust may be shattered and never recover, but with enough atonement and redemption, it may actually grow stronger. The cause of the guilt flag may have instead been the trigger needed to upset a broken status quo, and everyone's actually better off for it. The Carrier will usually always be held in some level of suspicion, especially the more heinous their actions get. Bad events happening to the Carrier will usually be seen with less severity than those that happen to others. People will tolerate more negative events occurring to a Carrier until the guilt flag is formally dropped— and for some, that may never happen. Even if you're falsely accused of something and forced to carry a guilt flag and then convincingly and totally prove your innocence, there will *always* be some people who associate you with the flag and decide you're a liability— others may doggedly insist you did it against all evidence because that's just what they heard first or because they just don't like you. Friendships may be permanently broken. Recovering from carrying a guilt flag may only allow the Carrier to claw back to a much lower level than before— if they were once the leader of a group, the best they can do now is as a low-level grunt. Marriages and unions may be broken, and the trust needed to bring them back may never be restored no matter the redemption arc's conclusion (though this is rare and fairly nihilistic).

#This is getting pretty long, but I hoped I got the point across.

To recap succinctly, a guilt flag is the set-up for a redemption arc. That doesn't mean a redemption arc actually happens or ends happily; it's just why a character needs to be redeemed if at all.

If there's anything I was unclear about, let me know; I've only recently tried organizing my thoughts on this point and really needed to turn over every stone myself just to see if I understood what I was talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

The word hero suggests that the character believes they are in the right, or that they are doing righteous acts. However that isn't always the case. Some characters are bad and they know it. They aren't trying to do good, and have come to understand and accept that. A protagonist is one who, for the sake of their own story, must grow, overcome, learn, adapt, and push themselves to the limit to achieve what they want.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that nine times out of ten an interesting protagonist must do either of two things. They must develop as a character to overcome their lie, or overcome obstacles that stand in the way of their truth. This is why a protagonist is more interesting than other characters who may be static or unchanging and don't play a major active force in the story.

&amp;#x200B;

If we see a villain character struggle to rise above the rest and best challenges that even our heroes would hassle against, we become more invested in the villain. To humanize our villains is to give them something to struggle against. An internal struggle will earn sympathy. An external one will earn admiration. Using these elements we give agency to the villain and make them seem like they are on the road to achieving their own goals. A similar road our protagonist is on. It parallels their journeys, and sets up a more interesting dynamic in the readers mind.

&amp;#x200B;

We don't always need justifications for a villain, we just need to understand their character. We need to know what drives them and what makes them like us. Do they have to deal with injustices, with hardships, and confusion? This may not apply to ever type of villain or antagonist. But I believe it gives a good indication of how we can humanize them and make the audience care about them by simply asking, if they were the protagonists of their own story, what would happen?",CatanimePollo,0,0,1598981492.0,2020-09-01 17:31:32

ik66m7,Writing Habits,"Hello all,

I was wondering if everyone could post their writing habits.  I am trying to get really good at the craft, and I want to develop a structured plan  to get me there (I have very little free time).  Here is what I'm planning to do.  Any suggestions are welcome. 

1. Three pages of freehand every morning.  I try to record dreams in vivid detail, any events from the previous day or any strong emotions that are coming up.  I try to be mindful of word choice, grammar and syntax, but I do not put pressure on myself to make everything sound pretty (although sometimes it does, to me at least).  The point here is for me to reduce inhibition and hesitation (I've been blocked for years) and become more creative and psychologically perceptive.

2. Choose a quote from an author I like and memorize and rewrite it to understand its structure and effect. Then I try to create my own sentence using the same syntax.  This practice has helped me expand my writing tremendously. 

3. Writing exercises: I have a book called Spellbinding Sentences that I do exercises from.  Basically, the book has different sentence patterns you can imitate, and it teaches you how to experiment in a fun way (I highly recommend this book, at least for beginners like me).  After I'm done reading Spellbinding Sentences, I will read books on plot/other aspects of writing. I want to be working on at least one skill at a time. 

4. A little bit of polished work each day (I have several short stories/pieces I'm trying to work on at once and I simply choose whichever one inspires me most that day and spend at least 20 minutes writing or editing. 

5. I also try to keep a reading journal where I record interesting words and my favorite quotes from book and songs (I am not disciplined with this though)

6.  Go on one artist date a week.  An artist date is an idea from a book I read on creativity.  You basically plan a 2 hour chunk of time to do something novel by yourself in order to ""get in touch with your solitude,"" or your original perspective.  You ""fill the well"" of your mind with interesting experiences that you can draw from when you write.

ikcgs5,I'm really starting to second-guess myself,"Hello Everyone! I'll do my best to keep this on the shorter side. (Heads-up, not the most positive post)

My story: When I first started college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. After my first year, I went to a community college part-time so that I could get my Associates, but work at the same time. During my last semester, I received a email promoting the creative writing certificate at the college. While it intrigued me, I decided to take the summer to mull it over because that meant more college, which meant more money. But, as you may have guessed, I decided to enroll in the classes. I took several different courses, including fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. I found that I thoroughly enjoyed taking the classes and that it rekindled my love of writing. It's been a few years since I took those courses or have done any creative writing because I've been busy completing my Bachelors and I've had a few other things going on. 

I know that there may be the potential that I am overthinking things, but I am starting to wonder if I am even a good writer (which is depressing tbh). I can't help but to think back to that year of creative writing. While I received mainly positive from my peers and professors, I can't help but to feel that it was obligatory. Why? Because the comments seemed surface-level, and maybe that was just because my peers were more unfamiliar giving feedback, but I felt that from my professors also. Not only that, but when the other creative writing certificate earns and I had our ""ceremony"" (it was really small. There was less than 15 of us getting the certificate), each professor had a student to write and sing praises to. The professor that had me, I had been in several of their classes and I really liked them, basically said how good I was at putting in the work to rewrite my pieces. That was it. But for the other student that she had and for the other professors, they complimented how great their work was. And clearly this is something that has haunted me for the past few years.

I know that I'm not the best writer and that what I do write needs a lot of work because I have less experience with it.

I have all of these ideas and worlds occupying my head, but I can't help but to feel discouraged.",Adventurous-March,10,7,1598929199.0,2020-09-01 02:59:59

ijvv60,How to Approach Diversity in Writing? (No TERFs or homophobes),"First things first: I'm trans, queer, and brown.

I say this because I believe that I can accurately include these traits into characters without poorly representing them; however, I often hear that including these traits in a character without addressing their ""implications"" is bad writing. I personally would just like a trans or queer or brown character where their traits are a minor aspect of themselves and simply exist for the sake of existing. I don't like the ""cishet white until proven otherwise"" attitude people have towards literature, so I have to ask, why is it asked of writers to approach diversity in a way that makes it so that people cannot have traits for the sake of having traits?

I think having a casual trans character would be wonderful representation, and if anything, it would make others feel as though they can simply exist without justifying their existence. Am I wrong in any way?

Edit: Thank you all for your insightful responses; I feel extremely motivated to stay true to my desire to create casually diverse environments within my stories.

ij9t01,About that quote I've read oh so many time 'Villains are the hero of their own story',"I don't know who first said that to me, or if I read it first. I've always like this idea, perhaps since I quite like writing dark characters, and in some works the villains are my favorite. The thing is, what I like most are complex characters, some of them are good and have lines they don't cross, but others might give you the chills if you spend any time in their heads.

Recently, I watched Silence of the Lambs for the first time. Before I saw it, I'd seen it mentioned on a few youtube channels. One of them dissected the scene where the main character meets the villain. As I was doing some brainstorming for a character of my own, I began thinking of that movie and a thought occurred to me. Does the villain in Silence of the Lambs know he's the Villain? My thoughts went a step further; are there villains out there that know this? Would my story be better served if my villain was self-aware? 

I remember watching cartoons. Most of those villains didn't have self-awareness. Then there are ones like Zuko, who, the moment he gains full-awareness he enters the redemption arc. He isn't like 'oh, my father does terrible things, let's join him' which is what it takes, really, to be a self-aware villain. (Which makes me wonder if his father was self-aware that what he did was terrible?)

There are a lot of protagonists out there I wouldn't call heroes, sure. Of these, there are a variety that are self-aware. They do bad things, they are aware they are bad, but still do them/allow themselves to be in positions where they will happen. (Also the do-bad-things-for-good-reasons kinds of characters live here most of the time) But what of the true villain of a story? Should they consider themselves a hero? Should they be considered as a protagonist in their own story? Each of these descriptions has a different feel to it, in my opinion, and builds a different sort of character.  

In the end, I can't come up with an answer that satisfies me. What about you? What do you think of the quote? Is it an idea that you like? Or would you rather have a character who knows he's the villain, knows what he does is evil, and does them anyway? What kinds of villains do you prefer to write?",nikkidasi,824,122,1598778025.0,2020-08-30 09:00:25

Hi everyone, I was so excited to find this sub! I’ll keep it as short as possible!

I currently have three published books (a trilogy for young adults), and am working on something new. I thought it was a really cool and kind of unique idea, even though it has some well-used tropes, if that makes sense? Kind of a new spin on stuff that’s been done before.

Today I saw a trailer for a new movie that looks exactly like the premise of my book! I’ve read a little more on it, and there are differences of course, but the theme, setting, and general idea is so similar.

I’m almost finished writing the book, and was hoping to send it out to my beta readers, and then my publisher to see if they like it... but now I feel like everyone’s going to think I totally ripped off a movie.

I guess I’m just looking for some encouragement, because I’m the kind of person who usually gives up because I’m scared to fail. Does this kind of thing happen all the time? I never experienced it with my last books, so it’s new ground for me!",ilovesharks101,0,6,1598904201.0,2020-08-31 20:03:21

&amp;#x200B;

Yet again, I need your guys' help. I have started writing, worldbuilding, and even kind of developing characters. I'm pretty on the way, and a few of my friends are giving me daily feedback on my writing and other things, and a few even offered to draw for me! (They're the best.) But now I'm kind of stuck. I'm going to go pretty in depth on what I'm trying to do here, so I understand if this is too long to read. a tl;dr is a bit far fetched though.

Okay, so here's my problem: I have started everything, but I'm doing everything at once now. I'm doing writing prompts on r/WritingPrompts right now and again which is really fun. I'm building my world, which my dad helps me with occasionally. My dad says I should start writing a plot before everything like making a real law for my kingdoms. I think I should make my whole world first before starting with the plot. I already have a vague idea, but I want to keep it on the sidelines. 

My dad is a really good writer and I have a lot of respect for him, so I don't want to throw his opinion in the dust. I do think he's right in a small section of my mind, but I'm still not sure. Where should I begin? Do I worldbuild first, do I develop characters first, do I make a magic system? Do I fully develop my kingdoms?

I also just don't want it to be all for the shock of it, and want to be sure the content has a point and is more deeply-affecting than in-the-moment horror or dread or unpleasantness.

ik1gxj,What are some more small actions I can put in-between dialogue?,"I've never known what to call them, so forgive me for any confusion. I'll explain. 

Those little phrases you use to convey a small action the character does to break up dialogue and just kinda give that extra bit of description, such as: 

She shook her head and sighed softly before biting her lip, her eyes glossing over. 

""I know what you did, Joey. I know everything. It's--..."" 

She trailed off, her chin trembling and her voice breaking with every other word. 

""It's better if you and I-..."" 

She sniffled and looked into his shocked eyes with her porcelain ones. 

""Pretend we never knew each-other."" 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, those little in-between phrases. For a one off scene like that, I feel like you can do it pretty simply without it becoming boring and repetitive, but in a lot of situations it's going to be a long scene. I recently re-read the book I'm writing from start to finish, and though before I thought it was pretty eloquently written, I now realize that these lines quite literally repeat over and over and over and over, much more than they should: 

'He shook his head.' 

'He (Insert action here) Softly, gently, quietly' 

'He bit the inside of his cheek' 

'He bit his lip' 

'He clenched his jaw/fist/teeth/' 

'He smiled softly, gently.' 

'He laughed quietly, softly, gently' 

etc, etc. 

This was a pretty long and convoluted way to ask a simple question; What are some more of these 'in-between' phrases I can use to just-- have some diversity in my book, because for some reason I can't think of anything other than these and it got a little irritating to read over and over.

ik00nh,Writing First Novel and Experiencing Loss of Voice,"For the first time, I am embarking on the journey that is novel writing. I have always experienced feelings of self-doubt while writing, which I understand is normal and something most, if not all, writers/artists/creators experience. 

But I'm really having trouble with it because my doubt is SO overwhelming that I feel it is chipping away at my distinct voice as a writer. I am finishing the first draft and as I go over the portion I wrote the day before I just feel so... disheartened. I can't write metaphors anymore. I can't spice up my dialogue. Nothing feels *good.* I was trying to think of a synonym for the word ""white"" yesterday and I couldn't think of anything that wasn't cliche and overused. 

I do not understand why this is happening. I consider myself a pretty avid reader and what I do read is broad: poetry, indie coming of age novels, fantasy, international literature, memoirs, etc. So I'm not sure why my voice, all of a sudden, is so tired and the cache in my head is empty.

  
Am I overworking my brain? I write everyday, for at least an hour. Often, at night, I will write on my notes app because I am up thinking about my novel. And as I write I have that voice that tells me, ""you will never be Zadie Smith..."" or, ""Ocean Vuong had his masters before he wrote his debut novel..."" (I do not have my masters; I just graduated with a BA in Global Literature though. Part of me thinks it matters. The other part of me disagrees.)  ... Am I just overthinking? Worrying too much? 

I just feel so lost. I also feel sad-- writing is something I have always loved, always *needed.* But now it just throws me into turmoil, because it feels like there is a dissonance between what I want and what comes out onto the page. Maybe this is the classic, eternal crisis of the writer. But because this is my first novel-writing experience (I've written short stories and a novella before), I'm wondering if that has anything to do with it. I don't know.

I'm trying hard to improve my writing and have been working on mostly technical/non-fiction stuff like blog posts, but I'm really eager to start trying out creative writing/fiction! I was hoping to find a book that might help me out with my weak points - I'm looking for something that talks about the actual style, flow, wording, sentence structure, etc. I'm having trouble finding something because almost all the books I can find for fiction writing seem to be more about creating the plot or characters, worldbuilding, or the writing process whereas I'm really looking for something more about improving my actual wording/sentences (I hope that makes sense).

One book I read and loved was [It Was the Best of Sentences, It Was the Worst of Sentences: A Writer's Guide to Crafting Killer Sentences](https://www.amazon.com/Was-Best-Sentences-Worst-Crafting/dp/158008740X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=it+was+the+best+of+sentences&amp;qid=1598832158&amp;sr=8-1) by June Casagrande. I really got a lot out of this, but now I want something more focused on fiction/story telling and style.

It's gone from this fun, funny, sorta light-hearted , probably mildly erotic romance... To a suspenseful, murder mystery, maybe even a heist thrown in there somewhere. Sort of a Thomas Crown Affair/Entrapment angsty romance. That's fine... But doesn't fit my original meet cute scenario at all. I mean, I COULD absolutely write that erotic scene into it, but... I'm not feeling it. 

My question... Should I just keep writing it as one story and see what happens, or cut them apart and back to square one on the original, fun scene I started with?

My question is, followed under: I begin my book with a lot of dialogue, (not an absurd a lot) but enough to make it clear that there are voices speaking to her. *Should I keep doing this throughout the book?* I notice a lot of novels I read stop these kinds of things after the first chapter, mostly with the narrator speaking to the character and the character actually hearing.

I was thinking of doing it with breaks, like the flow of the novel wouldn't be just dialogues of separate voices talking to her and themselves, but more like in POV switches where instead she just blurts out things out loud for characters to wonder what the voices are saying.

**Another thing I am struggling with**, is I fear the novel would be judged upon the first few paragraphs with *sooo* much dialogue (not an absurd a lot), but I don't know if it spells out a red flag, a false expectation, based on how many other novels start out and not continue.

I just finished writing about 1/3 of one chapter and in that section (1400 words) there is not really any direct conflict in terms of one person directly arguing/fighting with another, its more a chat between friends about their problems.  I think it builds character and they present different perspectives, and it relates to the protagonist's goals for both the story as a whole as well as their short term goals, so relates to the plot fairly directly.

After that section, the remaining 1/2 of the chapter does get very action + direct conflict oriented.

ijh1s0,"Straddling the Line between NA and Commercial Fiction, plus Word Count Question","Hi all,

I'm working on a novel that is ""technically"" New Adult but since that's not really a genre anyone is publishing, I'm pitching it as an Adult Commercial Fiction (In a sentence it's about a small town Drag Queen in her early 20s, but not a coming out narrative).

&amp;#x200B;

I initially had it as YA but I've since learned that since my protagonist isn't a teen, it won't sell (he has to be at least 21 so she can perform in bars in the US). There isn't really anything too adult beyond some dirty jokes and talking about sex. My first question is: is my instinct to go with pitching this as an adult novel the right choice given the age of my protagonist? I keep running into this problem with LGBTQIA+ focused novels because most of us don't get to explore their sexuality until post high school which takes them out of YA territory age-wise. I've asked a similar question in the YA writers sub but I'm curious what people coming from the opposite end of the question think too.

&amp;#x200B;

My story is coming to a close around 60k words. Is that too short? I can add more scenes with character and stuff but I'm worried because I was lucky enough to have a large part of my previous work critiqued by a very famous author who used to be a professor of mine and he said that I spent too much time with my characters lolligagging around just being cute and fun and nice. My plot moved too slowly. I've written this novel at a bit of a faster pace with less ""fluff.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the sake of conversation, let's just assume that what I've written feels like a full story and that as it stands, it doesn't NEED more writing for it to all make sense. I'm not saying that's the case but I'm trying to avoid ""write as much as you need to to tell the story"" type answers. I'm looking at this from a trad. publishing point of view only. Maybe I'm a sellout, but I write to get published.

&amp;#x200B;

SO: (TL;DR) Will a low-ish word count really kill me if I try to sell a commercial fiction book at around 60k words? I can add more, but I'm hesitant to do it just for the sake of adding words.

&amp;#x200B;

But if as a debut author I need to stick to the norm of 75-80k words, I'll make it happen. I just want to write chick-lit for gays.

So, I've been working on this fictional universe for a long time now, because I intend to use it in a lot of different stories that I want to tell. 

One of my main objectives fleshing out this world, since it's an alternative Earth, is giving representation to most cultures that, together, form the plural Identity of my native country, Brazil, where most of the narrative will unfold.

Two groups (or factions) in this world have a special relevance, however, one representing the African influences in Brazilian culture and other representing the native brazilian's, particularly the Tupi-Guarani, many cultures and identities.

I'm white, I have almost zero experience living with these cultures, and I feel that just researching about them isn't enough. But at the same time, telling a story in Brazil, with the scale that this story has, I know that is important to have those sides of our culture appropriately represented.

I have already thought about asking or paying someone else, that has more baggage about these topics, but this is just impossible to me in the moment. I simply have no idea on what to do now.

I'm writing a superhero story and at one point the protagonists come into conflict with some yakuza people. Someone asks (paraphrased) ""What the hell are the yakuza doing in the american midwest?"" To which someone else says they have no clue and it's probably something secret.


Do I the writer know why? Hell no, I just thought it would be cool. But now the reader at least thinks maybe I have a cool secret reason for it. It could end up as a meaningless thing the reader hopefully forgets by the next volume, or I could use it as a plot hook later. Maybe I'll decide they're working with some villain the heroes have yet to meet. Leaving it open ended with the hint of an explanation can be all you need sometimes. 


Same can go for magic/technology. There are some characters with advanced suits that allow them to control elements. A character asked how they worked, to which another replied ""How should I know? I'm not a scientist.""


Do I know how they work? Not really. Will I come up with an in depth explanation? Maybe eventually. Either way, the reader feels like the lack of explanation is because the characters themselves don't know, not because the author is lazy. 


I'm by no means a great writer but I like to think this sorta stuff can help a bit. Sorry if I sound stupid",TheLoneMage,88,19,1598679804.0,2020-08-29 05:43:24

To put it very bluntly, the reader should see a very tasty-looking ice cream (the relationship) , and as they reach for it (as the plot progresses in the characters favor) , you yank it away from their hand.

iis43b,I have two story to write and I don’t know what to do,"Hi everyone! I will try to explain my dilemma here, sorry for my English but is not my first language.
Back in 2013 I started a story and then stopped writing it (even if I already had the whole (more or less) plot in mind). It was my first serious story and I loved it. 

In 2018 (I think) I started a new one and even with this one, I had the all plot in mind but after a while I stopped (in both cases it was also because I suffered from depression and it was not easy for me continuing doing it). When I tried early this year to continue the one from 2018, I was stuck because I found difficult to write it since I cared about it a lot and I didn’t think I was mature enough (as a writer) to write it. 

So about a month ago, I decided to continue the one from 2013 because I always cared about it and I was sad I never finished it. Since then, for the first time, I wrote basically everyday and now I almost finished the first book. (The point is that they both are not standalone books, but they are gonna be a saga, with at least 3 books).

Now, I was curious and I read the first chapter I wrote of the 2018 story. I fell in love instantly and remembered why I loved that story so much. 
The point is that love them both, the 2013 because it was my first story and I love all the characters, the plot, everything, and I care about it a great deal, but it’s more simple, the 2018 otherwise is sooo much different and I’m very proud with everything I decided for that world. It’s also more mature and I think that the story is better.

I want to write both of this sagas, that’s for sure. 
The problem I have now is that I find myself wanting to write both of them at the moment. I was writing the 2013 first but after I read the first chapter of the 2018 one I felt that I also wanted to continue that one. 

What should I do? What’s best to do in this case in your opinion? I’ve never published anything in my life so I’m not really an expert.",lyannap,3,12,1598706577.0,2020-08-29 13:09:37

iifx92,Should you avoid sentences that start with a gerund?,"**UPDATE:** Thanks to some wonderful replies, I think I've realized that I'm using the wrong terminology here. I've learned that you should avoid sentences starting with a dangling participle or a misplaced modifier. I found a blog article on the topic that was illuminating: https://www.english-grammar-revolution.com/dangling-participle.html

So, if I could rename this title, I'd say ""Stop starting sentences with dangling participles/misplaced modifiers.""

There are others in here saying what I'm really complaining about is ""adverbial phrases,"" but whenever I look those up, none of the sentences look like the sentences I'm using as examples.

---

Gerund: a form that is derived from a verb but that functions as a noun, in English ending in -ing, e.g., *asking* in *do you mind my asking you?*.

Here are some examples of my own:

&gt; Dancing the night away, their feelings for each other grew.

&gt; Flying through the clouds, they squealed in delight.

&gt; Holding his hand, they walked off into the sunset. (ironically, I think this is a rare example that works better without a restructuring)

...and so on. Every time I write a sentence starting with a gerund, it sounds awkward when I read it, especially if I read it out loud. For this reason, 99 times out of 100, I restructure my sentences that start with a gerund during editing.

But, I notice a lot of amateur writers starting sentences with gerunds all the time. I understand why: it's a very easy way to restructure a sentence, especially if you've got too many sentences starting with the subject and you want to mix it up.

Every time I ask, I'm told that starting a sentence with a gerund is perfectly fine, but I still feel like it sounds weird most the time. Here's a better way (in my opinion) to structure the first two examples:

&gt; Their feelings for each other grew as they danced through the night.

&gt; They squealed in delight as they flew through the clouds.

&gt; They walked off into the sunset, holding hands. (as I said, I think the original has better structure. To make this version Palatable, I had to remove ""his,"" and technically change the meaning of the original. That said, maybe someone out there can think of an even better structure than the original -- one that I'm not seeing)

I'm currently reading a book that won a Hugo award. I think the prose flows well, so I wanted to test my gut feeling about this. I read a whole chapter, looking for sentences starting with gerunds, to see how often this professional uses them. I only noticed one: `Shaking, Syenite lowers her hands slowly.`

There may have been others I missed, but (in this chapter, at least) the author seems to agree with me: Avoid sentences starting with gerunds.

I’m a fairly decent sized writer on Wattpad, I wouldn’t say as big as some, but I am fairly high up there on reads. And with that of course comes a bit of attention. Over the 4-5 years I’ve been on Wattpad though, I’ve maybe gotten one or two PMs that obviously scream scam (user that was created like 10 seconds ago, weird funky text that doesn’t look quite right etc.) but typically with those scam PMs they rarely share an email to converse with them further (proving that they are trying not to get caught). This one however, was new.

I just received a pm from an account though it’s been on Wattpad for a month but it’s very obviously a throw away account. But it claimed to be from a Liason at Webnovel (which is an app I had probably about 6 months ago, but ended up deleting it). And normally, I would immediately disregard these kinds of messages but it seemed like it was legitimate. It provided 6 different means of communication including a WhatsApp number. Which I thought was way crazy for a bot to do. It’s a lot of effort for a scam in my opinion. And, I happened to find some interesting articles about Webnovel and how they seem to be trying to pull writers away from Wattpad which explains why they have to make throwaway accounts due to the threat of being banned. Though even in the message they make it clear that I can keep my stories on both Wattpad and Webnovel though so I’m not sure if they have just changed their tactics lately or what.

And I would show what they sent, but I would need to blur some things. Wouldn’t want to put their email, social media, and number out there if it is real.

iiex7y,What to do when you discover a book that is nearly identical in plot and concept to a story you've been writing?,"For the past year or so I have been developing a fantasy series that was inspired by one of my favorite periods in history.  I had been planning it, working out the worldbuilding, creating characters, and plotting a story and a general plan for the first book as well as possible sequels.  I have been really invested in the idea and was pretty sure I wanted to try and publish it (not for a long time, obviously, I'm pretty new to this).  Just a few days ago I discovered a book by a fairly famous author that came out a few years ago that is basically my entire idea.  There are some differences, for example their work is more high fantasy whereas mine is more historical but still has some fantasy elements, but other than that it is nearly the exact same.  I don't mean similar in the sense that they're both Tolkien-esque fantasy, or medieval high fantasy, I'm talking a very niche topic.  Based on the synopsis that I read, the setting has the same features, the characters sound the same, and really every major facet of the story is almost the same (even some places in the story have the same name).

I understand that people will say that ""every story has already been done"" and ""just write what you want"" and everything else, but really it's so similar that if I ever tried to publish my idea as it is now, it would be borderline plagiarism.  Thankfully I haven't wrote that much so I haven't lost too much actual writing, but I have lost almost a year of worldbuilding and plotting.  If anyone has been in a similar position, what did you do to fix it?  Did you rebuild your idea from the ground up?  Did you read the other works so you could ensure yours was different?

ihskwh,Killing your darlings,"By now, I'm sure we're all very familiar with this common piece of advice. I think there is some confusion with it though.

A few months ago, I completed my plan for one of my characters' arcs and I was super excited about it. I'm still excited about it. The other day I explained their history to someone and they thought it was cool, too, but after I gushed about how much I loved this character, they looked at me and said, ""Well, you know what they say: you have to kill your darlings."" I lost my passion in that moment and we moved on to other things.

The thing is, killing your darlings doesn't mean that every time you love something in your story, you should (literally) kill them or take them out. Don't steal your own passion. You're writing a story because you're passionate about the characters, you're invested in the plot. There would be no point otherwise.

In the case above, my character and his arc was central to the progression of my main plot. It was important to my other characters just as much as it was important to me, as the writer, in my own daydreamings. It's a completely different thing than if this character's arc divided from the central theme of my story. If that character had gone on a side quest that had nothing to do with the MC, and I got really invested into this side quest, but again, it didn't follow the main plot or theme, then I would justifiably have to ""kill my darling."" For example, in a story about a characters making a long and time-pressed journey, if they stop in a village for *three chapters* (instead of a scene or two, or, at the most one chapter?) and have a little side story with the villagers there, you're going to hurt not only the reader's attention, but maybe even your plot. Obviously this isn't concrete, but you get the idea.

Killing darlings isn't about cutting passions, it's about trimming back distractions. And if your character or side plot becomes so exciting to you that it seems almost more important than the MC or main plot, but is still parallel to your central theme, that's okay. Maybe alter your plot so that this exciting one that keeps growing isn't off to the side. Do whatever you have to do. Just keep your passion.",g_ogglez,386,67,1598559167.0,2020-08-27 20:12:47

iicvcs,Newbie Questions and Worries,"Hello!

So, I recently decided to start writing (my first novel :,)), and I'm wrapping up the planning phase/starting to type chapter 1.  I've actually been lurking here for a bit, looking for tips, but I have been so overwhelmed by the content available... 

First, there are the ""do not do this or I will drop your novel""/""major pet peeves"" type posts that I've been taking note of. Stuff such as ""don't describe your character by having them look into a mirror"" or ""don't have a main character that deals harshly with henchmen but is merciful to the final boss"" or ""don't even think about touching certain cliches (like the misunderstanding trope that leads to an unnecessary, avoidable mess)""

Then, there are other types of things to keep in mind such as ""vary sentence length"", ""Make sure your characters all speak in a distinct/personalized way"", ""don't invent too many new words"", ""every scene should further the main plot"", etc.

There have been many helpful resources as well such as tips for how to make consistent progress, how to describe skin colors,  what differentiates third person limited and first-person POV, etc. 

The lists for all 3 categories could go on and on, and I'm sure there are many other tidbits that warrant a new category. But, I guess what I'm trying to say is, there's so much information that I'm not sure where to start or how to proceed.  For example, with the ""do not introduce your character's appearance by having them look into a mirror"", I understand why that's the case. But then, how much farther does the mirror cliche extend? What other ways of introducing appearance are lumped into the same category? I'm worried, and I look at what I wrote so far and wonder if my introduction of my protagonist's features is executed in a clumsy manner. This dilemma happens with all the other ""things not to do/to keep track of"" type advice, and I rapidly lose confidence in what I'm writing. This is my first novel, so I've accepted that it'll be amateurish in execution. However, I still want to bring the story to life to the best of my ability. 

What are your thoughts, experiences, advice, insights, or anything really? How have you guys dealt with this in the past, and/or how do you avoid these ""off-putting elements"" as writers now? I would greatly appreciate any feedback! If you read this far, you're a champ :)

What I am asking is... In my novel, should all of the allusions that I write be *all* references to Greek mythology, or *all* references to the Bible, etc? Would it be dicey to intermix allusions (particularly ones that characters embody) from different ""categories,"" so to speak?

For instance, in *East of Eden,* Steinbeck alludes to the story of Cain and Abel quite heavily—a Biblical allusion. I read this a while ago, but it seems that he stuck with Biblical allusions throughout the novel, which provided a sense of consistency.

So, let's suppose that I am writing two characters who represent Adam and Eve...Biblical allusions. Would it be strange to then have other characters in the story that embody, say, Poseidon or Odysseus, as these would be allusions to Greek mythology?

In having both Biblical and Greek mythology allusions, these characters or ideas do not exist in the same ""realm"" of literature. I know I can write what I please, but as a reader, how would this come across?",eternit-y,1,3,1598660577.0,2020-08-29 00:22:57

ihtdpj,My own writing disgusts me; help,"Hey,

Earlier today, I had this sudden epiphany regarding the disgust I feel towards my own writing. It's still beyond me where this feeling comes from, but I can now define it. You know how your spoken voice sounds like ""whatever"" to you when you speak, but sounds terribly off in every audible property when you listen to a recording of it? That's exactly it!

The common advice I hear about the voice thing is that you just gotta trudge though recordings and get used to it. Well, I've been doing argumentative writing for a long, long arse time. When I go back to my old writing, it's solid technically, pretty effective even, but still feels convoluted. I've made money writing and translating business correspondence, and, again, it's correct but stinks. However, this feeling is overwhelming when it comes to fiction. I cannot stomach it. It feels childish and pretentious. Long-winded. Lacking finesse. Dumb.

ihg0vg,What I learnt over the past two years of writing everyday. Some advice.,") You need to build a habit of writing everyday. Same time. Same place. Everyday. It will be hard definitely in the beginning but if you keep at it, the workflow comes naturally. I know alot of writers struggle with sitting down and writing. The thing is, it's only a matter of initial 5-10 minutes. Once you get past that, you actually get into the mood and mindset to write. Building a habit also eliminates any excuse for you to depend on sole inspiration and motivation. 


2) Start with short stories. Ray Bradbury advised writers just starting out to focus on writing one short story a week. By the end of the year then, you should have 52 stories and by no means, you will have all 52 stories bad. The point here being, you should focus on writing so much that you're not overtly attached if one or two or even ten of your stories fail. Because you need to learn that your worth is far beyond just one project. Also, short stories provide you with an easier ground to practice your craft. If you get into writing a novel straightaway, you will probably not get it right and might just give up. Work on your craft through short stories. Get rid of the million clichés out of your system before you finally tackle the novel. 


3) Always read stories atleast twice. First, read for entertainment. Read for the pure joy at being pulled into a beautiful world and watching interesting characters go about their lives. This is the reading where you are reacting to the story. If possible, do mark which parts of the story grab your attention the most. On your second reading, examine these parts specifically. Break it down. Analyse what techniques did the writer use to create that effect on you. If there was something that didn't work for you, try to figure out why it didn't work. To improve your reading skills as a writer, I would suggest you read ""Reading like a Writer"" by Francine Prose. Really amazing book. 


4) Read across different genres. My MFA people had this elitist attitude which made them confine to only the serious literary texts and completely disregard popular fiction. Now everyone has their own preference but you shouldn't be looking down upon any type of writing. There's alot you can learn if you read with an open mind. Popular fiction, the really well written ones, can help you with constructing a gripping plot that keeps the reader hooked from the very beginning till the end. It can teach you how to build tension, suspense and conflict. Literary fiction can teach you how to write beautiful prose which sings. It can help you paint a vivid imagery with words. It can also help you to deepen your characters. So read in your genre/preferred writing but also read beyond your comfort zone. 


5) All great stories have a point to make. We tell stories because we have something to say. Stories are the best way to do so because it helps us develop an emotional connection with the readers and when they are emotionally involved, they feel much more inclined to listen and understand what we are trying to say. You can obviously lecture them but...how many of us hate it when that is done to us? Anyway, if you want your story to stand out, think for a moment about what you want to say. If you can summarize your story in one sentence, it would be great. 


6) For the love of God, please be aware of your own thinking and internalised prejudices. I have seen many talented male writers write women horribly. Most of them succumb to describing their female characters by focussing on their boobs, nipples or god knows what all sexual characteristics. By doing so, you're defining them by only their sex. You're telling the world that there isn't really anything more to them than boobs and nipples and an ass that swings when she walks. Please. Please. Be better. We live in a patriarchal society and we are so imbedded into this beliefs that we are not even aware of this. Please take the time to question your perception. Question yourself as to why do you think the way you think. I would suggest, research helps alot in this. Especially if you're writing a life you're not familiar with. 


7) Grammar and Punctuation. I can't stress enough as to how important this is. If this is not done right, it might even get you rejected by agents and publishers way before they get to the interesting parts of your novel. It's as important as any other part of your story. Please don't forget this. 


8) Editing. I would suggest you switch off your internal editor when you're writing the first draft. First drafts are meant to be shitty. Just do a word dump. Write whatever comes to mind. From the second draft onwards, edit mercilessly. Read ""Self Editing for Fiction Writers"" by Rennie Browne and King. 


9) I know you might wanna get published but don't write solely for the sake of getting published. Write because you love writing. This is a career filled with a string of rejections. A lot of rejections. And if your love isn't string enough, then you won't be able to make it through till the end. 

10) In continuation to the above point: No matter how many times you have been told to give up writing because it won't make any money, or how many times you have been told that your own writing is bad.... Don't give up. Never, never, ever ever ever give up. Truly great writers are the ones who are determined to succeed at all costs. Trust me, when you come out at the end as a victor you will be proud of all the battle scars.",Idrinkvodkawidsugar,1666,240,1598509835.0,2020-08-27 06:30:35

ihyv1v,"[Advice] On ""thought"" verbs by Chuck Palaniuk",""" In six seconds, you’ll hate me. But in six months, you’ll be a better writer.  From this point forward – at least for the next half year – you may not  use “thought” verbs.  These include:  Thinks, Knows, Understands,  Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires, and a hundred  others you love to use. ""

This advice, and the article linked below, has helped me tremendously in advancing my writing. 

The tl;dr version is basically this: verbs like the above and others that allow you into the character's mindset aren't unpacking everything that is making them think/feel such things. Create a scene that unpacks or implies that the thinking and the reader will do the heavy work of ""oh, they must be feeling X"" or ""That person must want Y"".

I'll admit even after reading and applying this, I still am guilty of the occasional ""realizes"" or ""remembered"". As with anything, this is more of a guideline than a hard and fast rule, but it does offer a better way of unpacking the emotions and context of characters and scenes, making the reader want/think/feel the things your characters want/think/feel without explicitly saying so.

ii58iv,What is new under the sun: Nothing or Everything?,"I always thought writing is 100% creativity, and I grew up reading books like 'Harry potter' or 'The Lord of the Rings'. I read more than 100 stories and none of them were the same.

Then one day I saw a post in r/writing about the phrase 'Nothing is new under the sun'. The post said that every plot and character possible was already done. I was shocked because that was not what I have thought at all. And my dream being a (Game) scenario writer I was 2x more frustrated.

I thought about the subject a LOT. And I found that there were possible flaws in the concept 'everything has been done' and here is it.

1. The number of possible stories are just too much. I hate the concept of 'Tropes' (For me thinking about them ruins my emotions while reading and writing) but let\`s say there are 1,000 tropes that exist today. and 100 tropes will be used in a long story. that\`s 1000! divided by 900! and that well surpasses the amount of stories that were created during human existence. Plus, I asked in reddit and a lot of people said creation of new tropes was possible. (Just think about the possible themes. Was there ever a story about the bases A T G C of a DNA talking about how to create and manipulate a human to their success? My idea.) Add them up and BOOM! you can always write a different story.
2. No one is the same. People write up different stories and stories almost always reflect the author\`s thinking, life, etc.
3. If all stories that can be made were made, there will always be copyright issues in every movies, novels, etc... There must be a spot of creativity in every story, so that it wouldn\`t be like that. 

But..the question still remains if I PROVED this, whether I\`m wrong, or the 'creativity' I\`m talking about is just a small part and everything else is 'tropey'. 

And about plots. If I created a plot that is like A-B-D-G-E-A again-O-K-Q-ending P(sort of) will it already have been used? Can you always create a plot that didn\`t exist before? I don\`t mean the classic 7 plots like 'The hero\`s journey'. I don\`t care if I see them 1000 times. I just mean the 'specific' plot, like the plot of 'Angels and Demons'. \*possible spoilers\* (A killer chases the protagonist, you look from place to place at old relics to find the next killing place, the killer dies by the protagonist, surprising villian twist and so on...) 

I just care if they will always be different... and that I will be able to make ones different from all the others.

ii35sj,Pacing with complex plot: how to avoid the too perfectly wrapped up ending?,"So I went back and read my latest draft on a book Ive been working on for a long time. Im pretty happy with it (or as happy as I ever am with my writing) except for one big glaring problem: everything is wrapped up too neatly.

Real life is messy and disorganized. People dont magically fall in love at the right time or overcome fantastic character defects in the exact time frame we'd like. Yes it is fiction, so we can bend the rules. The tone I want is one of cheer, so things working out isnt the problem per say.

However, this still does not sit well with me. The problem is I don't know how to go about fixing it. I could extend some of the plotlines and make room for a sequel, but then I feel like I haven't delivered on what I set out as a promise to the reader on what the story would be (and as a debut author, theres no guarantee of a sequel). Alternatively, I could move events around and have some stuff resolve earlier, but here again I run into problems as the 2nd act is fairly rigid in making the pacing work. The only thing else I can think to do is take a minor plot line embellish it a bit and then leave it unfinished with a soft resolution (but clear knowledge that theres more) but that seems like cheating (and id assume would be noticeable).

Any suggestions? Is this even a bad thing? What has your experience been like around books (your own or others youve read) that wrapped things up too neatly?

ihvax0,A rough guide to making a tense scene,"Hi all, i was watching something that kept me on the edge of my seat and it made me think how it was doing it. I started to understand that it was setting some things up subtly, so I've created what i think what was happening.

Caveat: this is not gospel or a formula to always follow, if you have your own way of doing things that's great and it's definitely encouraged not to follow this religiously.

So How to create a tense scene:

1) Set up a bad thing that is going to happen, basically make it clear that someone is going to die or get injured or worse if the chararcters don't try to do something. (Sometimes this can just be inferred by the audience, dead bodies in forest = bad thing for forest dog walkers. Or it can be skipped if audience has prior knowledge, jewish person in ww2 Germany doesn't need any set up)

2) Have the thing that will cause the bad thing be present in the scene. Have whatever it is constantly try to foil the chararcters in making it to their goal. If the chararcters need to get somewhere the bad thing that wants to kill them will try to make them falter.

3) Show things that could go wrong, and if you want to add even more tension make them go wrong. (Sometimes inference is enough, if the chararcters need to get away by car you can just add tension by having the car splutter, you actually don't need the car to break down. This is all about the anticipation in the audience that something will go wrong)

4) Continue on with this, constantly making bad things that scupper the chararcters from doing what they need to do, until the thing the chararcters need to achieve is done or the bad thing catches up to the chararcters (third way is the chararcters decide to face off with the bad thing, but this should be done sparingly because any subsequent bad thing will feel less frightening if the chararcters win)",Xercies_jday,9,3,1598568175.0,2020-08-27 22:42:55

Notice something? Exactly. They fucking ***suck.*** The character names are trash. They're uninspired but still great. The last one is literally called The World. Let that sink in.

That's not to say that you should name your characters after the sounds that Cthulhu makes in the bathroom whenever he eats Taco Bell. Make your names easily memorable, and make them sound fine and fitting &amp; you should be fine.

What REALLY matters is everything else: how you design your character, if the story is interesting, what their personality is like, how they talk &amp; act etc etc. The reason why those names sound great is because of the story behind it.

As you may have already guessed from my question or from the text below, I am not a native English speaker. I consider myself an English learner, and yet I am willing to become an English writer.

Because I want to put what it takes to succeed, I started a challenge with myself: writing 100 articles in plain English over the next 30 days. Each article must have a minimum of 500 words. But by the end of September I shall have published 100 articles.

While I see many advantages in pushing myself into discomfort, I also have moments of doubts: is it really worth it? Shouldn't I first try to learn how to write in French before trying to become a writer in English? And most of all: is it actually possible to become an English writer? I know that in theory, this is possible (through hard work, commitment, passion, dedicated work, ...). But do you know any, or are you yourself, people who became ""successful"" English writers? (by writer I mean ""who makes a living out of writing"", so a blog in English counts as one yes)

ihket5,Question about close 3rd person: describing non-protagonists’ actions,"I have a revision note from an editor to make sure I stick to close 3rd person POV by not slipping into the minds of other characters. 

The example he gave was a dialogue tag that hinted at the personal thought of a non-protagonist—this is easy enough to fix; however, I’m wondering how far the close 3rd person needs to go when describing character actions in general. 

For example, if my story is all about character A and his/her observations of the world, if I add a sentence like, “character B put the groceries in the car,” would that still qualify as close third person so long as character A witnesses the action (of putting the groceries in the car)? 

Do I need to specify character A bearing witness to it? Ie. “character A watched character B put the groceries in the car.”  I hate repetition, so I don’t want to oversaturate the story with “he/she watched,” “he/she noticed,” etc., especially if it’s implied.


Even if character A—the protagonist—witnesses character B’s action, does it break the “spell” of close 3rd person if the focal point is shifted to something character B is doing? 

For example, if character A has a paragraph of observation, and the next paragraph starts with “character B put the groceries in the car,” does it weaken the POV, especially if there’s not something in the sentence to connect it to character A? 

Maybe a better close 3rd person sentence would be: 

Character B put the groceries in character A’s car.

OR 

Character A watched as character B put the groceries in the car.


I am fully aware that I may be overanalyzing this. 
The note I received may be more about fixing parts that imply thoughts of other characters, as opposed to actions that focus on other characters.


Still, let me know your thoughts. I’m posting this topic for safe measure—I don’t want to hand in a weak revision—but also because I find it interesting how slight changes can affect the reader’s mental play-out of the story.",HalloweenHollow,7,8,1598532493.0,2020-08-27 12:48:13

Now I'm thinking about translating the story into English. I'm debating with myself whether to keep the poetry as is, or dig up an English translation. One thing I put considerable effort into with that novella was to recreate the mode of speaking seen in the Icelandic Sagas... at least up to a certain point, since I needed the text to be easy to read.

ihjd7m,I want to write a novel but I am terrified.,"I am a writer with a decent amount of experience. I have made a living off my writing for my entire adult life, including a few brief stints as a copywriter, but mostly as a screenwriter. I haven't done anything particularly impressive or noteworthy as a screenwriter but I am very comfortable with the form. Recently, I've fostered a few ideas that I think would be best realized as a novel. I don't write prose often but I am an avid reader and would love to write a novel.

Unfortunately I am completely terrified of the medium. One of my greatest struggles as a novice screenwriter was determining whether there was enough story for a feature length screenplay. I had many misfires, alternating between stories that didn't have enough meat on their bones, or ones overstuffed with plot points and reversals. Now I feel confident in how to start a story, sense the size of it, and give it a half decent shot of completion.

But a novel seems so amorphous. I feel like I have no idea how much time events will take, and whether I will have too much to say or not enough. It seems so much harder to grasp the shape of a story that could vary in length by hundreds of pages within the same medium.

ihj00g,Are character interactions bogging down the story?,"So I'm in the starting stages of my story and the plot hasn't picked up yet. I've written most of the initial exposition but honestly, the bulk so far have been character interactions between established relationships and new ones. It's a fantasy story and while I'm really enjoying writing about the friendships of my characters and new budding relationships, I've started to feel concerned whether or not that's bogging down the story itself. 

Like I said, it's only been the first few chapters thus far, and most of the exposition and set up is already written but I'm still worried that all the character dialogue and interactions I've been writing that aren't necessarily advancing the plot in any significant way are just going to be boring and mind-numbing.

On the other hand, a part of me feels as though that in order for my characters to feel real and relatable, I need to show how they interact with each other and how they talk and show the readers what their stories are through their conversations and interactions.

I guess my problem is a fear that I might overdo it, or that adding it all in is just pointless fluff, so to speak.

I’m obviously no expert, but I really want to get better at avoiding this problem. I have asked teachers for help on this and every time was told to just write shorter sentences.

ihsikd,Is space fiction overdone?,"Every so often there's a major hit in a genre, and then everybody rushes to copy it. Twilight heralded a whole gaggle of vampire/ urban fantasy shows and books; the Hunger Games launched several female-protagoist-in-dystopian franchises, and now looks like space is the newest thing. The new Star Wars trilogy kicked up a tons of remakes and new stories about space.

I get that you're supposed to write what you love, but realistically I think vampires/ dystopias are oversaturated at this point. Extending that phenomenon to space fiction? is it it worth it to attempt something within space, assuming the project will take 1-2 years to finish (maybe the hype will have died down, or still lingering)?

Thanks!

Edited to add: Thank you everyone who commented!

igsmh3,Urge to write about time travel is constant,"Is anyone else fascinated by this subject more than most? I seriously have been obsessed with the idea since I can remember. 

For me what I enjoy about it so much, is how simple the concept is at first glance, yet so difficult and complex the more you think about it. It’s because of this, that I find a well written story about the subject better than anything else.

I tend to reach too far into the complexity, then wind up completely turned around, and lost. I feel like this isn’t an uncommon issue with this concept... how do some get past it??

The last idea I had seemed so simple.... then next thing you know it’s anything but.

EDIT:  A big part of this problem is by my own creation. I feel this need to create scenarios that include limits, regulations, and consequences. Basically no just random time travel without planning, or purpose. 

I had a concept recently that gave the traveler only 6 hours in the past to accomplish what he needed to. The catch however was in the consequence. If he wanted to go back exactly one year in the last from the current date, after that 6 hours he’d be returned one year in the future of the date. Start 2020, go to 2019, return in 2021. 

If whatever he changed, had some major effect on the timeline, he’d have to go back to fix it obviously... but doing so would be 2 years each way. So on and so forth. 

Wound up complicated easier than you’d think tho.

They feel like they have this magnificent story in their head, and as soon as they put it down on paper, or even think about doing so, it becomes extremely difficult.  Either because it's not defined enough, or because they feel like their writing is subpar, or something else.

Here's what I would recommend doing:  Go to r/writingcirclejerk and scroll through hot.  If you take the humor and satire in a positive manner, it helps relieve some of the stress you're feeling.  The world is no longer weighing down on your shoulders, you can now relax.

It doesn't just help put you in a better mood.  The extremely over-the-top exaggerations on there can help you realize when you're hyping things up too much, or going too far overboard yourself.  The reason satire works is because it looks at an imperfection in whatever topic is being discussed, and puts a magnifying glass over it.  It may not be direct advice, but it at least makes you more self-aware when you write, and that's always a good thing.

You shouldn’t dismiss works because the author didn’t write what the know. It happens to much. They say a white person cant write a story about a black family fighting for freedom from slavery. Or that a straight person can’t write about an LGBT+ person fighting against society. It’s completely wrong.

You may be a man, but you can still write about a woman proving herself to her boss, or you don’t have to be Jewish to write about the holocaust. You do, however, have to be willing to put in the effort to research.

However I'm struggling to write my character actually doing something, I mostly understand how best to write a scene and describe what is going on, but how do I describe my character doing a task, without constantly just saying the he was doing that task.

&amp;#x200B;

Take this example;

As with all good days, young John Woods’s started with breakfast. The day was already in full effect by the time John even began to stir, and it wasn’t of his own accord. “What do you want for breakfast John? Bacon and eggs?” His mother shouted up the stairs. Before processing what he’d just heard, the familiar aroma of bacon started seeping into the his bedroom, it didn’t seem like there was much of a choice in the matter. “Yeah sure!” he shouted sleepily, a slight pause before remembering, “Thanks!”. As John rolled out of bed, he found the pile of clothes that was left on the floor from the previous day, sniffing them to see if they were acceptable, “they’re fine.” He put them back on, stretching as he did so. Looking around his room, small beams of sunlight were coming in through the gaps in his blinds, lighting up the dust particles in the air. The currents of bacon smells swirling  through the room. Today is going to be a good day.

ih5e3a,Sources of Research and Inspiration for a Novel Idea,"Hey everyone!  


The other night I was hit with a huge brainstorm wave and I realized I had an idea that may be interesting to write and would have huge potential if I could do it right. We've had stories set in fictional Wuxia settings such as Avatar TLA and we've had it based in African cultures like Children of Blood and Bone, but as someone who has always had a fascination with the steppes and Tengri culture and history, why not do a story in a similar vein of epic fantasy, but have it based in a Eurasian Mongol/Turk setting?  


The idea as is has a lot you could tackle, the rise and fall of the Khans and the factions that broke off from his death such as the Golden Horde. The rise of dogmatic rule in the West as Tengri was slowly forgotten in place of the adoption of the Islamic principles. The far north in the Altai regions of Russia, and how the Mongols disagreed with each other on a regular basis, and of course the Feud between China and Mongolia.  


The thing is, I've read up on the historical summaries and various sources, and I'm looking for more hands-on accounts of different culture differences and philosophies to have a more structured idea of what a good authentic world like this would need. I was hoping that in here I could see if there may have been books written similar to this idea or any resources to find good information. Basically, inspirational works or informative works I can look at to further develop this idea. Any suggestions and feedback are welcome!",shadowsfall0,3,0,1598469533.0,2020-08-26 19:18:53

igd7sj,"Is this a cute idea for helping to describe characters, or is it hackneyed and forced?","This is my first post here and I'm pretty sure this is allowed, but I apologize if it's not.

Twenty years later, I'm picking up a story I started writing when I was eleven. Obviously a lot has changed in terms of my perspective and skill there, but the bones of the narrative are good, which is what inspired me to have some fun with it.

Anyway, three of the characters are sisters who are all adopted from different countries, a detail that my narrator thinks about briefly a few chapters earlier. There is a coffee shop scene later where the young women are all chatting and making what seems to be an established, recurring joke that some of them ""got the good \[physical feature\]"" as though they're actually genetically related. In my eleven-year-old version, this was very on the nose and I explained the joke very explicitly (i.e. this is funny because they're not actually related).

Do you think it could be worthwhile to try and keep this cute game in as long as it's much more subtle, or should I concede that this is something that would work better in a different medium and move on?

**To make this question more general:** What do you think of using dialogue/character interactions to hint at a character's physical features?

### My guesses

* **Overture** means that you’re a musician.  Its literary analogue is an opening statement of the main body of text that is not immediately part of the main story.  It could be an unrelated chapter for mood-setting or a one-chapter prequel before the rest of the story occurs.
* The **introduction** can be words from either the author, publisher, or editor.  It’s the place for meta-textual notes on the rest of the work.
* A **preface** is something that I associate as being written by the author more so than publisher or editor but could be written by all three.  I think of it as less meta than the introduction.
* When a preface or introduction by the author already exists and the editor wants to add their meta-text, it is time for a **foreword**.

What is, at first, a seemingly abstract and roundabout description of a quick jaunt through archival analysis quickly plunges into a self-aware critique of the teaching and understanding (or lack thereof) of history in today's context. The diction is unrelenting and rock solid.

I am most certainly not writing this character for the purpose of laughs or for any other reason than that I just want to introduce a character who will provide a different perspective than other characters, just as is the case with any character who speaks in any dialect.

All I know is that AAVE is an actual dialect that exists, obviously, and I want to write dialogue in that dialect that actually reflects it as it is spoken in the world today.

It's very tempting to just slap a ""good enough"" title on a book and tell yourself that your publisher will pick a better one, but truly you are the person best equipped to come up with a strong title. Also, sometimes your publisher doesn't change the title and then what have you done to your book, you lazy fool?

A great title *can* grab a potential buyer's attention and generate interest in your novel, so it's worth trying to come up with a great title.

**What a good title accomplishes:**

**1) Conveys genre**- The buyer should get some sense of what genre the book is in from the title. Obviously this is somewhat subjective and there is a lot of overlap and flexibility, but it's pretty clear when a title is completely missing the mark. For example, you would never call a mystery novel *Searching for Us.* Even though it has the word ""searching"" in the title, it's screams ""romance"" because of the word ""us."" You would also never call your romance ""Silent Lovers"" because that title is creepy as fuck and the use of the word ""lovers"" doesn't make it feel romantic.

**2) Sets the tone of the novel**

Funny novels need funny titles and serious novels don't get to use puns and witticisms in their titles. If your prose is dreamy and poetic, your title needs to reflect that. If your work is lean and punchy, your title needs to be as well. Your title needs to evoke the same emotions as your book does. *On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous* is a great title for a book by a poet. *Kill the Farmboy* clearly conveys humor when applied to a fantasy novel.

**3) Gives a hint to the content/topic/themes/etc.**

Your title needs to be related to the content of your book. It doesn't necessarily need to be immediately clear to the buyer/reader how the title relates to the book, especially for literary fiction, provided your title is catching their attention in some other way (#4, typically); however the more commercial your work is, the more important it is for the title to be directly related to the content of your novel. 

This is also an argument against generic phrases in titles. The more specific your title is to your work, the more it will stand out from other titles. Avoid cliches and idioms in your titles (unless there's a good reason), to keep it feeling unique.

**4) Raises a question in the buyer's mind**

This is the most important factor for me and it's the difference between a title that works and a title that's great. You want a title that makes people pick up the book to find out what it's about. This can be accomplished in a few ways:

- Unusual pairings and comparisons

- Subverting title expectations and norms

- a hint at a greater mystery

**What makes a title bad:**

**1) Misrepresents the book**

As stated above, if your title communicates the wrong genre, tone, content, etc. you are setting up false expectations for your story and your reader will be disappointed when they read your book. The title of your book is the very first promise to your reader and if you fail to deliver, they will not trust you as a writer.

**2) Generic**

There are a few things that can make a title generic. You can use generic phrases and language or you can use generic structure. I talked about generic vs. specific language already, so let's talk about structure!

- THE [NOUN] is generally fairly boring structure unless your noun is something intriguing or specific to your work. I tend to think that this type of title, in order to be successful, needs to be supported with strong cover design, but as a title removed from context, it's not a compelling structure. You can avoid this issue by adding a specific/unique/unexpected adjective.

- A/THE [BLANK] of [BLANK] and [BLANK] has been overdone at this point. There are a thousand books like this and it has become a cliche in the fantasy genre. However, coming up with fake titles using this structure is a *lot* of fun and I highly recommend it. 

- Character name as the title- Unless you are writing a book for young children (picture book or chapter book), I'm not a fan of a character's name as the title unless the character has an unexpected/unusual/compelling name that raises questions in your reader's mind. Calling your book ""Miranda"" would be boring. Calling your book ""Bertha Yamamoto"" could be compelling.

---

Here are some titles that I like and why I like them. This list is a reflection of my own taste (in genre and topics), so I'm not necessarily saying that all these titles are perfect and will catch everyone's attention. This is more just an exercise in ~~navel gazing~~ analyzing why specific titles might attract a reader.

**Magic for Liars** by Sarah Gailey- I truly did not even care what this book was about because that's a GREAT title. The thing that makes it work for me is that magic while being a very generic term, has good connotations. That association is subverted by pairing it with ""liars."" Also, I personally like unreliable narrators and lying as a subject, so including the word in the title told me that it would be a good fit.

**Mostly Dead Things** by Kristen Arnett- Another book that gets me on title alone. [What does it mean to be mostly dead?](https://i.imgur.com/DB9IKbE.gif) That question alone intrigues me enough to pick up a book. Also, death is another one of those topics that will get me every time.

**An Unkindness of Magicians** by Kat Howard- I haven't actually read his book yet, BUT I REMEMBER THE TITLE. The use of the word ""unkindness"" as a collective noun in the title is so fucking intriguing. I keep meaning to read this stupid book and I have no idea why I haven't done it yet.

**Midnight's Children** by Salman Rushdie- My friend told me that she heard that this book was originally called ""The Children of Midnight"" but that phrasing puts too much emphasis on ""children"" which is the less interesting word in the phrase, so swapping it around made a more compelling title.

**The Lies of Locke Lamora** by Scott Lynch- This book does the opposite of Midnight's Children. This phrasing puts ""lies"" first, which is the more interesting component of the title. I also think that pluralizing lies makes it more intriguing than just a singular lie. Everyone tells one lie, but a person that has a lot of lies is a liar and that's interesting.

**10 Minutes 38 Seconds in this Strange World** by Elif Shafak- This title works for me because of the specificity of the time. It speaks to a book with an interesting framing and makes the reader want to know why that amount of time is referenced.

**The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle** by Stuart Turton- Again, the specificity of the number is intriguing. Also, I'm always into books that reference death in the title. Also, just as with *Midnight's Children* and *The Lies of Locke Lamora*, the more interesting component of the title comes first. The number of deaths is the interesting part, not the name of the character.

**A Game of Thrones** by George R.R. Martin- This title is ICONIC. It works well for me because of the contrast of the comparison of ruling to a game. Because it's so familiar now, we don't register it as a great title, but it really is.

**The End and Other Beginnings** by Veronica Roth- Again, we have an usual comparison that raises questions in the reader's mind. Also, I personally think that it makes a vague allusion to death and the concept of the afterlife, and we've firmly established that I'll read pretty much any death book.

**Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine** by Gail Honeyman- This title works for me because the phrase ""completely fine"" clearly communicates that the titular character is not fine at all. The blatant false statement (...lie, I suppose) on the cover makes the reader want to know not only why the character is not fine, but also why the believes or wants others to believe she is fine.

1. You write in stream-of-consciousness like the last chapter of Ulysses. Just slam your nonsense thoughts on the screen and then place them together, so they make sense.
2. You make a bulleted list and write the one-line summary of a paragraph pointwise.
3. You go haywire and accumulate tons and tons of dialogue comparable to let's say a movie script.
4.  You forget all punctuation but write normally. (somewhat similar to 1.)
5.  You race through the plot or just get it down with zero monologues, zero dialogue, or a run-on express story.
6.  You set a timer and complete your daily goal by writing trash.
7.  You write like me, think about the story very carefully, think about descriptions, think about dialogue, and write two paras max per day. You do so much editing that it feels that this draft is gonna be your final.
8. Last but not least, you draw pictures or cards of your scenes and then write according to it.

igms5b,Killing animals? (Hunting scenes),"So I'm wondering, what's you guys' opinion on describing the killing of animals? In most fiction I've read where people actually go hunting, the killing often happens off-screen. I'm currently writing a story in which the main character has a hunting background, and he's teaching others to hunt. During a scene which is important to one character's development and arc, the killing of an animal caught in a snare is described. I'm not talking about ""blood gushing over his hands, squirting into the snow as the rabbit kicked its legs in a futile attempt to live"" describing, but rather the simple ""he slit its throat in a quick motion,"" which I think is okay. My problem comes with the fact that I think a lot of readers (me not necessarily included) would be put off by the image a rabbit caught in a snare and then mercilessly being killed, even if it fits the story and is an important moment in it.  
Do any of you have very distinct opinions on this? Definitely do this or make sure not to do this? Am I a horrible person for this? Any tips on what to do if my way is ""definitely"" the wrong way?

igxxdp,I'm too intimidated to go back to my writing.,"It's as the title says.

Basically I started writing my book about 2 years ago, and I had made quite a lot of progress. It is a murder mystery mixed in a sc-fi world of my making, but the problem with it is that it's been a LONG time since I actually worked on writing the book.

I'm trying to be the kind of writer that puts those little hints that once the culprit is revealed, looks like glaring indications of who the culprit was, and other such small detail oriented aspects of my book. However, having been over a year since I worked on the book, (I'm at around 60k words, on the second and final act of the book) I am just too intimidated to start writing again.

It just feels like I'm going to have a different writing style, and I'm going to contradict myself and the story plot points that I have made before. It's not that I don't want to write, I am so excited to put together the second half, as this is the part where a lot of exposition of my world comes in and you get to vibe with characters that have unique personalities, but I just can't get myself to even open the document because it feels like I'm going to ruin my previous work.

igrmgq,Advice on changing a character's name?,"The current story I'm working on has a crew working on a ship (independent, non-military). At one point, they meet a military general who wants to defect. Initially, the narration only calls him 'the general' until he tells the main character his last name, then he's referred to that way. Then about half a chapter later, mid-defection, we learn his first name.

I *think* I've dealt with it well enough, but I can't help but feel a little cautious that I've changed a character's name 3 times. Is that breaking a rule of some sort? If the character is likable enough, the reader is invested enough in the story, and the scenes regarding his name are clear enough, will it be confusing for anyone?

I've considered the reverse... you learn a characters name, then learn nicknames or ranks later, and it doesn't cause any issues. Maybe I'm making something out of nothing. I just want to get some reassurance so I don't have to keep worrying about going back to fix it (assuming it isn't a problem).",gambiter,2,4,1598413324.0,2020-08-26 03:42:04

ift10q,'Flat Arc' and 'No Arc' are not equivalent,"Hi everyone,

earlier today I saw a post of someone asking about characters with no arc throughout the story, if it could be done etc. A lot of comments mentioned the flat arc, and while it's good to shine a light on it, with all due respect, I felt like it didn't answer OP question. On top of that, they were treated as interchangeable. Even if the end result is the same (character doesn't change), they are not.

An arc is a journey the story takes the character on, to test their system of belief through a series of challenges. In the case of a flat arc, the character is already right and ends their adventure re-assured on this.  
With no arc, there are no challenges. The character simply exist, and the story is not concerned with how or what they think.",dontgivemeawards1,1054,225,1598288706.0,2020-08-24 17:05:06

igt77c,Do web novels ever get published?,"I've been wanting to write a story I've been developing for a while now, and decided that a web novel would probably be the best way for me to go about it, but I just wondered if they ever end up getting published. I don't expect I would ever get published, I'm just curious. And I'm talking about English-language ones, specifically. I know a ton of Japanese light novels originate as web novels and publishers pick them up through various means, but does that ever happen with English ones?

Personally, I like how Japanese light novels are set up, with a greater focus on dialogue and some occasional artwork thrown in. And so if I were to ever get published, I would *prefer* it to be as such. A lot of web novels are probably like this anyways. I don't care for western-style novels much anymore; they just burn me out fast when reading them.

So that's why I wondered if English web novels ever get published or have any interest from publishers. Again, not that I'd expect I'd ever get published, but I do wonder whether there is even *any* chance at all. I know that there have been OEL manga (though I would debate whether or not half of these are really ""manga"") and manfa that have been published.

Due to this, I've decided to start audio-recording my notes, as it seems more in line with my way of editing to be able to simply listen to my own voice, notes, comments, and concerns with my writing, pause, and find the exact place in my manuscript I'm talking about before continuing.

I don't know if anyone else takes notes this way, but I would like suggestions if anybody knows a good, reliable digital recorder where it's easy to use for note-taking and easy to transfer files to a hard drive or device through a USB. I am but a simple writer; technology is not my strong suit.

igor34,Some advice I wanted to pass on to others,"A book I'm writing has many characters, the main of which were twins, one girl and one boy, and the main *main* character is a young man. While writing it the first time, I stuck to what was in my head, a love interest between the two males, and I was happy with it. It wasn't overall focused on the relationship, more on the adventure, and I was very content. Then, while switching to a new computer, my file was corrupted, so I had to rewrite it and other stories I'm working on off the top of my head.

In the process I started to wonder if I should continue with the relationship as is. It would be simple enough to pass the relationship to the twin sister and have a straight main character. I wondered if it would sell better. If it would be an easier read. If more people would relate to it. Of course, I also worried about the hate that having two men together in a story would cause. Would bigotry get in the way of a successful book?

It was my dad who told me to forget the worries. It's easy to go the easier option, the path of least resistance, but I was raised to fight for what I want. I was raised to believe in myself and my creations. If changing the story was what I wanted, I wouldn't have been worried over it. I would have written them to begin with. And in my head, these two were meant for each other. He was right, ultimately. As always. If I had changed them, they wouldn't have been nearly as honest characters, in my head or on paper. And I wouldn't be honest with myself.

My advice is this: Be honest with yourself. Don't let someone else's opinion on your creations change them, or change you. If it's what you'll want, it'll be an epiphany, not another worry.",givemehthaprompts,2,16,1598402201.0,2020-08-26 00:36:41

igkhac,The first conversation of main character with someone is bilingual. Tips would be appreciated...,"Hello everyone, I'm trying to keep this short, but this is my first post on this subreddit, funnily enough about the first scene of my very first book, and I could use some advice. 

I'm trying to write the first interaction between my main character and a supporting character that will be of importance later. They don't speak the same language, and don't have any resources to find out what the other person is trying to say except for body language. They're both quite intelligent so they should be able to understand some things, but the problems I'm having are the following:

-It's the very first appearance of the main character and her first conversation. I want to convey that she is smart and also some basic information about her (name, maybe general appearance, etc.), without making it too obvious or making her look weird or dumb because she doesn't speak the language of the reader, but I feel like the way I'm writing it she comes across way too  cold and calculating. While I do want her to appear mysterious and cool, at the moment it feels like she's not very likable are easy to relate to. 

-How do I make the scene interesting while also describing their movements? I feel like I'm repeating words and phrases like ""she did../he pointed at.../by doing that he/she wanted to say that .. "" so it gets boring. At the same time, I am unsure how much is self explanatory and which gestures I actually have to explain to the reader.

-How far should the understanding between the characters go? Although they're both smart, I'm unsure how much they should actually be able to understand from simple body language, especially since they come from very different backgrounds which means that different gestures could mean different things to them. 
Of course the own name and naming objects by pointing at them should be fine, but what I'm thinking about is actually describing more complicated matters like going from point A to B, asking why someone is at point A in the first place, how they got there, and explaining this to the person who asked. Do you think this level of conversation would be possible, and if yes, how would you convert it into body language?

I hope someone might have an answer to at least some of the things I'm struggling with right now, and I'm also happy to answer questions if needed. I just tried to write down the problems as clear as possible without giving away too much of the storyline, but I understand if more context or information is needed.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there any tips you great redditors have in regards to creating your story? I am writing a thriller so want twists and turns but i want to avoid it getting too complicated. I have seen some people hang up notes and a story line time line to see visually their story and important bits to remember but i wondered if there was any other ways? 
2. Is there important things to remember when creating a story? I have read many books and so far feel that what i have wrote has the same feel and effect and potential of other stories i have read but i don't want to fall in to a false sense of security with it? I also never studied writing in depth. I don't know why now, in my late 20's i'm inspired to create something but i feel even if its for fun, i'd like to achieve it. But not studying this particular matter i'm concerned there is some important factors that i am not aware of.
3. Similar to above, i never studied literacy in depth. Creating a story with making sure my constant flow with a first person point of view is understandable and correct and including conversation with other characters etc. I would like to have someone who is more knowledgeable, proof read it and help give me some pointers if i am making common mistakes. Is there somewhere/someone i go to, to proof read my story? I'm in the UK. I don't have the funds to just pay for help on a regular basis but is there a person you go to and pay a fee for this kind of help before you go on to publish? Also somewhere that doesn't charge the earth? I've seen some advertisements on other sites that do this, however, i feel nervous of trusting someone online who may be affordable, but may not be trustworthy? Also is there a point that is best to get this done? I would imagine the best time is when you have finished your story. But i fear i may spend so long working on it that when i pass it on to someone they may say how much needs improving and then i have to go back and change a lot. I would kind of like to know my mistakes early on.

I have read through other threads and seen advice such as become more knowledgeable with grammar, spelling, paragraphs etc. I am often researching things such as grammar etc, to make sure i am using everything correctly. I am using microsoft word to help with any suggestions and corrections i may miss. I am trying to do a lot my self but due to dyslexia and sometimes struggling to take in information i feel at some point i will need someone to go over it for me to help anything i may have missed.

igrugp,Cultural Appropriation: Where is the line?,"I have some concerns that the story I'm writing may border on cultural appropriation, and I'm sure I'm not the only writer on here who has this concern. My hope is that we can use my stories premise as a case study to discuss cultural appropriation and figure out what we think is and isn't appropriate.

So the background lore for my story involves an alternate history for the origin of mankind where we move here from a dying planet to begin again. This means that a lot of cultures that exist on earth where brought from this old planet. The story mainly focuses on the native american people. I take elements of the story from Paiute folklore. For example, the people people that predated the native Americans in my story could turn into animals, the Paiute believed in a people that came before them that could turn into animals. The Thunderbird is an important creature in my story, the Thunderbird is an important creature in Paiute folklore.

So now that you have the background let me express my concerns.

1. I am an american with European ancestors. I have a lot of guilt about what my ancestors did the native american people, so it doesn't feel appropriate for me to profit off elements of their stories.
2. The Paiute have a story telling season and it is inappropriate to tell their stories out of season, and it is never appropriate to write them down. Even though I'm not telling their stories, it feels like pulling elements from them and writing them down might still cross the line.

Now that we know my story and my concern, let's make it more general. Is it ever appropriate to use elements from cultural stories when you don't belong to that culture? It must be appropriate sometimes, because sharing stories between cultures is a beautiful thing. At what point is a story so similar to a cultural story that you're basically stealing it? What role does the power gap between to cultures play in determining whether something is cultural appropriation? How can we be sensitive to other cultures and avoid cultural appropriating when we use their stories?

I hope this sparks a useful and enlightening discussion for us all. I know this might border on political and there is a lot of different opinions out there on the issue so let's make sure to keep it civil.",SirWallaceIIofReddit,0,20,1598414246.0,2020-08-26 03:57:26
ig8s3a,Reading your own story,"I have a general question:

when you are writing a fiction, do you ever worry that what you mean don't come across? Not the type of worry regarding if the sentences are clear but concerning the whole of the story. Sure there are some inner motives that lead the writer to the piece in the first place. But I think there is a secret chemistry the writer should sustain, that allows the reader to sniff enough of these original ideas to get around the story (and hopefully understand and create their own thoughts at the same time) but also keeps the remaining a secret.

I just worry if I'm keeping too much of the essence to myself sometimes. Sure, there is a nice picture called the story that most would like to read ( I hope ) but it is not as alive as I would like it to be. Or that it is, but it is just too much of a puzzle that most readers are not equipped to deal with (and they shouldn't feel the need to be ""equipped"" anyway)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I made myself understood here. I'm not writing in English and this worry of mine originated in Turkish language. I am curious whether others deal with it and if they do --how so?

ifxig9,Be very careful if you write a hypocrite into your work,"A show I love is Bojack Horseman and one of the most contested characters is Diane Nguyen. Among other things, Diane’s main character flaw is hypocrisy, which is a major reason why she’s so disliked: she says women need to stick together and yet she sleeps with her ex husband while he’s dating somebody else; she says she needs her husband to be honest and yet she lies that she was somewhere else for several months just to avoid him. 

It sucks because Diane has an arguably great arc. 

I thought that Diane was the only example, but I realize that hypocrisy is a major flaw that turns people away from good characters or good points. Family guy has a speech aimed at Brian Griffin about how awful he was. But because it came from Quagmire, nobody liked it because it was hypocritical: Brian is a terrible person because he abandoned his son, despite the fact Quagmire willingly abandoned dozens of kids and Brian and his son left amicably. 

Elena Gilbert is meant to be a vanilla girl next door, so it makes her hypocrisy and the hypocrisy of the rest of the cast all the more apparent. So Elena, despite being main character, is hated by a large portion of the fanbase. 

I’ve learned after a while, but hypocrisy is one of the best and worst traits to give any character. And if it’s not, it’s kind of up there. Hypocrisy is in and of itself bad because you don’t practice what you preach, so why should I follow you if you aren’t setting an example? If your parent says to eat your vegetables or no toys, and yet they’re eating McDonald’s every night, you won’t want to eat the vegetables. 

Don’t get me wrong, it does make for an interesting character. Judge Frollo’s hypocrisy in Hunchback of Notre Dame made him a way more compelling character. But if you want the character to be sympathized with, tread carefully. Maybe have them be called out, or work through the hypocrisy.",CapriciousSalmon,21,9,1598302122.0,2020-08-24 20:48:42

ifi8sz,From Pantsing to Outlining,"When I began my writing journey I thought I was an outliner. I'd take an idea and figure out each character, their motivation, what their purpose was inside of the story. I'd take each scene and put introduction, climax, resolution and write my story to that, but I would never finish a story, I wouldn't even get half way.

When I figured out everything in the story I realized, for myself, that I told my story without even writing it and didn't feel the NEED to write it anymore, which of course isn't good.

So I started Pantsing, and it was wonderful. I didn't even start with a character or a plot, I just started with a question and began writing. Very quickly I had my characters, their motivations, but I didn't really know where the story was going, and that was to my benefit. I was excited to see what my characters would do, what climaxes and resolutions naturally came. And once I finished my WIP? It was a mess lmao. Loop holes, questions raised that were never answered, inconsistency. It was a disaster.

So I took my entire WIP and cut it apart into different chapters. I had the skeleton written out of the entire story now, but instead of a ten page outline it was a two hundred page first draft. I took each chapter and each act and separated them, outlined what was brought into light and what needed to be answered or removed from the story all together.

I Pantsed my way into editing, and then used my outlining knowledge to give my story that rigid structure. I originally thought that I would be an Outliner, or a Pantser, but in reality I was just both.

ifzq6b,"Can you become a writer if you have ""never"" written or gotten published before early in life?"," 

TL;DR  lengthy and possibly corny post on my dangling relationship with  writing during most of my life. Advice. Do all ""real"" writers start  writing seriously since they are young? or just should I give up? how do  you know if writing is your calling?

It  is a hard question to ask. However, I feel as if every writer that  existed has started with a very obvious love for the letters, talent  which was later developed in the form of short stories, poems essays,  etc published at an early age (10-20 years old). Also, most writers  worked/are currently working as journalists or related careers, degrees  in literature or English, or any kind of job that involves, you guessed  it, a lot of WRITING! Then, there is me.

I  wanted to be a writer ever since I was 9 years old. Why? I do not know  exactly. I liked stories, but never told one, but tried to. I even sat  down to write one, showed it to my father, but he told me it was like  one of the shows on the T.V I was watching as a kid. I felt ashamed and  since I did not have any other better idea, I just left it like that. I  liked books, but did not read them (did not know where to start or what  to read) my dad had a lot of books, but they looked like complicated  books for grown ups. There were no public libraries in my town on top of  that.

I still felt that itch  however. I started reading a couple of years later, mostly out of luck. I  just grabbed what seemed an interesting tittle (Arabian Nights) and was  totally hooked. It could have been any other book, a boring one, but  no, destiny guided my hand towards the pages of that amazing story, and  soon afterwards, literature and writing was again what I wanted for me.

During  High School I did most of my reading in my desktop computer on a lot of  pdf files of ebooks. As I said, we had no libraries, nor bookshops. I  wrote some poems out of inspirations. I wrote a couple of short stories  that were asigned on an unrelated subject during classes and were  regarded as beautifully writen by my professor, I lost them, nor they  were published of course. I attempted to write a short story on a  pre-determined subject for a contest. Mine was not selected. And that  was it.

I enjoyed most of the  essay writing assignments during my courses at the University (I studied  economics). My biggest aspiration was someday be able to write articles  on politics or economics for the newspaper and get them published. I  wrote 2 articles maybe, that were sent to the newspaper but they did not  care nor published them. So, I just stopped trying. I still loved  stories and still read books, but not with that deep crazy passion of  the ""typical"" writer. Maybe I just did not think writing was possible? I  don´t know. I thought maybe that writing was a task for more  intelligent/gifted people. I thought you wrote out of inspiration!  Anyways, I kept writing the ocassional poem, but kept it for me, all  that publishing business I just did not get it, nor understand how to  ""get into"" that world.

Time has  passed, I am 28 years old. As you can see, writing as been something  that has been put under the carpet during all this time. Out of fear,  out of ignorance, out of lazyness, out of procrastination, who knows?  Yet, it has always been ""there"", like a prisioner in shackles uttering  muffled undistinctive screams of despair, because time, it seems, is  running out. Yet, maybe I do not write because I have nothing to write  about? Am I fooling myself into thinking I want to write, when in fact I  just ""kinda"" like it? But how do I explain the complete satisfaction I  have experienced when I just reread what I just produced and say ""that  is what I wanted to express and it is clearly and concisely put into  words""? How do I explain the flow state in which I inmerse, on those  rare ocassions in which I come up with a story and the hours just pass  by, like unrequested visitors?

I  would like some advice on this as it is destroying my self-steem. There  are just a couple of things that are worth doing in this world besides  expressing the complicated realities of self, yet is it for me? is it my  calling? Sorry for the long post or potential typos, English is not my  native language. Take care and thank you.",notawriterlol,0,25,1598308974.0,2020-08-24 22:42:54
ifsgx5,Do you get anxiety about writing or being a writer?,"I apologize in advance for the essay.

Lately, I've come to consider myself not just a person who writes, but as a writer. I hope the distinction makes sense. I'm not sure when the swap happened, but it's both comfortable and uncomfortable. I feel like it's a major part of who I am as a person now. It may be due to the long term goals and promises I've made for myself, which I've never previously done. I'm confident of my abilities—or so I thought before I recognized the anxiety. As you all know, writing is often long stretches of hard work without positive reinforcement. You almost need to be confident, to some degree, in order to see the work through to the end. I had a short story published in a journal years ago, before a long writing hiatus. That's about all the confirmation I've had, apart from beta readings done by a friend of mine in the industry (they're a published poet). Still, that's not nothing and I'm privately proud of it, though I don't tell many people.

The self-identity of ""writer"" is, on one hand, a nice thing to settle in to at thirty years old, particularly after the tumultuous period of self-doubt and shifting values experienced by most of us in our teens and twenties. On the other hand, being ""a writer"" makes me feel anxious. I don't get anxious *while* writing, only *about* writing; perhaps not even that, but about allowing myself to identify as a writer. Maybe it's impostor syndrome. The only palliative avenue I've found for the feeling is, simply, to make myself write. I *have* to write every day, even if it's only a few hundred words. Until I write a page or so, I feel overwhelmingly anxious and unsettled. It's not a pleasant feeling. Do any of you know where I'm coming from here?

Here's where I am getting tripped up. If each subplot has its own narrative arc, where should the subplot hit its climax, in relation to the main arc? Especially since subplots should in some way affect the main plot, where do they land in the main plot to best advance the central tension, without diminshing tension by resolving a subplot too soon?

I don't believe these techniques mutually exclude, not at all. Hell is The Absence of God by Ted Chiang and The Husband Stitch by Carmen Maria Machado are examples of what I personally felt were a success in both being enjoyable and compelling me to finish.

I know I have a lot of work before I get to submitting to agents/publishers (as my current preference would be traditional publishing over self), but I wanted to sort through some confusion regarding pen names before I got to that process.

My name is very common and ordinary. So, I have been trying to sort out some potential pen names for when my novel is complete. As I want to start to frame myself as viewing this as a second name instead of be caught off guard if I do have successes. 

I have plans to either keep my first name the same, and change my last name. Or, go by my middle initial and last name. Would you be more likely to pick up a novel by B. Rogers (example) or Amanda Crispi (example)? Do you even decide if you want to pick up a novel by the author's name? If the author has a long name do you dislike the length/difficulty in pronunciation? Am I thinking too much into it?

iffa31,How can you tell whether your WIP should be kidlit or for adults?,"I always liked the very simple, straightforward style of children's books, to me a really good piece of kidlit can be as direct and earnest and moving as a Bresson film. So I gave writing a middle grade novel a shot. I really like the result, but I've been discussing it with my friends and we're starting to come around to the idea that it might be better reworked for adults as some of it might be inappropriate or go straight over children's heads. (The villain has a complicated relationship with his mistress, for instance.) I've been arguing that children can handle it and my friends are underestimating them, but now I'm not so sure. There are a few other odds and ends, like I became very interested in the adult characters' romantic and sexual lives (I've written a few racy ""fanfics"" for the amusement of myself and others), most of which is not going to make it on the page for obvious reasons, and I also can't seem to find any contemporary comps, which worries me. 

I might want to rework it and then try querying it as an adult novel that's written in a kidlit style with a twelve-year-old protagonist, because you'll have to pry that innocence and earnestness out of my cold dead hands, and just pray somebody actually wants to buy it.

If you've waffled between writing a certain idea as meant for children or meant for adults, how did you resolve the issue? What sort of signs should I be looking for?",meradorm,1,2,1598231005.0,2020-08-24 01:03:25

if4p4b,"People from the Anglosphere, do you read something else than Anglosphere books? If yes, does it influence your writing?","Hello people,

So, as a French-speaking European (Belgium), this sub seems to be dominated by people from the Anglosphere. And for me, it shows in the type of questions asked here and in the advices given, since the codes and ""rules"" of writing, or the issues related to the discipline, aren't really the same in the Francophonie. Each language has its own culture and difference when it comes to writing/books, hence why I often can't really relate to things here, because of the cultural differences Francophonie has with the Anglosphere. 

To me, and I may be wrong of course, it seems/looks like people here only read books/writers from the Anglosphere world, and only follow the codes, rules and issues of said world. Which is a bit ""strange"", because in my country, reading writers from everywhere around the world (although translated in French) seems more common, giving us more variety is styles and types of stories and writing. But as I said, it is just an impression I have when reading posts here.

iest4z,A question about fantasy books/writing styles from a non writer to you.,"I have a question. At or toward the end of all fantasy series/ books there is a point in time where the hero is stuck in some situation, that makes it look hopeless as if they’re they going to lose the final battle, not save the girl, overcome the final obstacle whatever it is, basically they aren’t going to make it. 


I understand this is obviously because if the hero just ran in and saved the day instantly there would be no suspense, and the end would be boring, and the author would have wasted however long it took to build this whole epic adventures climax up for nothing because the end would be flat. 



During this period in MOST fantasy adventure books I’ve read, specifically series, there are flashes around between the main character/ group and other people around the setting that are doing other things to set up for the last fight. These people, although they usually have some significant role, are usually sub characters (idk what the proper term is, secondary characters or whatever) and these things they’re doing to set up, although they may provide some background or clarity on what’s going on in the world at the time, are usually extremely boring. And I often find my self irritated that my focus is being brought away from the main characters and I have to dredge through some bland alternative plot to get back to the goodies and excitement going on with the main guy/s or girl/s. 



Here is my question: is this flipping back and forth USUALLY just to clean up some last character development , is it supposed to be more of a suspense tool? To keep you wanting to get back to the main character? And to keep the story from ending too quickly? Are there other reasons I don’t see? 



I just find myself feeling less in suspense, then irritated because my sense of suspense is somewhat ruined by moving away from the characters that the suspense is built around. Almost like my immersion is being broken by having to switch away from the main story line. I feel like this happens in to many books for it not to be some sort of agreed upon writing technique that is used for a specific reason, and that’s why I wanted to come to you guys.


TL;DR: why do people break my immersion by swapping story lines away from the main characters right in their moment of greatest need. 


Sorry for the Novel and sorry if this is a dumb question. Also sorry if my use of punctuation is horrendous, my teachers always told me I use to many comas as if I’m speaking not writing and never take a breath and I’m sure some people here will notice since it’s a writing sub, so apologies in advance.",Mutedinlife,2,15,1598138847.0,2020-08-22 23:27:27

ier6l1,Oof.. Advice for a beginner?,"Hello everyone!

As much as I think I have the creativity and dedication to be a writer, I think I may lack the skill. After getting feedback on my first chapter, I realize I have A LOT of work to do and a lot of learning to do. So this is where I have a dilemma. I’m already 5 chapters deep into my first “real” attempt at writing a novel (about 12,000 words) and am not sure what the best move is for success. I was thinking taking a class or two or joining a writing group might be helpful. 

Should I ...

Keep writing my current first draft while I simultaneously take a creative writing class?

Pause my work while I take the class then essentially start over or at least reassess what I’ve already written?

Or finish my first draft then take the class and use what I learn to help me with all future drafts?


Is taking a writing class a good idea? Have any of you done it and did you find it helpful? Online or in person? 

Any other suggestions are welcome as well! Thanks I’m advance!!",NimbusEnigma,2,8,1598132924.0,2020-08-22 21:48:44
ieum1g,Losing interest in my book series after I finished the first final-revision manuscript. What should I do?,"I started working on my dream dark sci-fi series called ""Dollhouse"" about two year ago and finished my first manuscript but I feel like I've gotten bored of my series. I mapped it out over seven books and I think the amount of time it took to complete one book really made me lose interest over time now i'm contemplating if I want to even continue the series. It kind of bums me out considering that I've been mapping my work out over five years and for me to just get bored with it. 

I've been reading a lot of Lovecraft and got inspired by a 1985 film called ""Angle's Egg"" (btw check it out its an hour long, free on YouTube, with subtitles) and now I want to draft a surrealist ethereal series I'm calling ""God Ate the Sun"". The idea of a fresh start with new ideas and a shorter book count is really tempting but is it okay to flip-flop like that? I fear that I might have the same issue happen to God Ate the Sun and then I got the first book of two series I don't want to finish.

ie10w4,Puppets vs Kittens: Writing characters with LIFE in them,"I was responding to yet another post here in r/writing asking how to flesh out characters, and I came up with a way to think about characters that might be helpful to other writers with fleshing out their characters.

**Puppets vs Kittens**

A puppet is just you, your brain, your personality, your everything, pretending to speak out of your hand. It doesn't have a personality. It isn't real. It's just a sock you pulled over your hand, and now you get to say your words through a sock.

The characters created by newer writers are often just puppets, and are simply standing in, mouthing the lines the writer tells them to say. They are flat, lifeless, and don't feel ""real"" or ""exciting"" or if you have a bunch of different characters they can all feel very similar, because they are all using the same source: they are just a proxy for YOU, the writer.

Kittens, on the other hand, are impossible to keep in one place. They are constantly trying to escape, explore, get out of their box, and see the world. They are persistent, lively, and don't follow your orders or direction very well.

You know you have an excellent grasp on your character when you are writing a scene and they surprise you. They do something unexpected. You think you are writing a love scene, and suddenly she grabs a sword from the wall, swings out the window on the curtain, and makes her escape into the night.

""Oh shit,"" you think. ""That wasn't supposed to happen!""

Now your mind is spinning... she didn't make love to the prince, like she was SUPPOSED to do, and now she's outside... at night... with a sword... and he's laying in bed... doing *WHAT!?!?* 

Now BOTH characters have gotten far more interesting. Why? Because they aren't pale shadows of YOU, they are exerting their own personalities and stretching their newfound powers. They've leaped off the screen into the movie theater, and are looking around and thinking, ""Ooh! This is cool...!"" *(Ever seen Woody Allen's, ""Purple Rose of Cairo""?)*

**Breed Kittens. Dump the Puppets.**

Your characters should be kittens. They should be rambunctious and somewhat unpredictable. It is your job as the writer to expose them to scenes and environments and other characters that they will leverage to move the story forward in their own way.

**Pantsing vs Planning**

This inevitably will bring up the arguments between ""pantsing it"" - writing without a clear plan, and just going by the seat of your pants - or planning out your piece, whether it is cue cards or an outline or however you like to plan your storyline.

""Aren't you just advocating for pantsing it all the time?"" I hear you ask.

No.

What I have found useful is to pants it with a new character to flesh out who they are and what they are like. Make up a scene, put them in it, and see what they do. No plan. No goal. Just let the kitten loose and see what happens.

Do this two or three times for this character, putting them into different types of scenes... a love scene... a chase scene... a quiet moment of reflection... and you'll have a strong feeling for the character of the character (har har), and what kind of kitten you have raised.

Then, build your box: go to your story outline or plan, and pick a scene. Why is this scene important to the story? Who is in it? Why is each of them there? What does each character want to achieve from this scene before it ends? And what happens when one of more of them do not get the outcome they want?

Then put your kittens into the box you have built and let each of them explore and roam and try to get out of the box. (Or fall asleep. Or go get a bite to eat. Or attack another kitten.)

**This sounds hard.**

If this sounds hard, or like a lot of work, or you don't think your characters will do anything when you let them loose, then you know you don't have good characters yet. They are just puppets so far, and have no individual life to them. And nobody wants to read a puppet reciting your words... they wanna see a box full of kittens, all full of energy and vim and vigor and trying to explore and get out and have an impact on the world.

Pick any character you have. Put them in a scene they would never be in - a Chicago cop in a 14th century castle in England, or a teenage computer programmer on a merchant marine ship - and see what happens. Write two or three pages.

Did your character surprise you? Did they do something unexpected?

If so, you have raised a kitten, and have an interesting character for your story.

If not, give the character a prejudice or a handicap or a belief that you don't personally hold. Try again. Iterate on the character until something sparks in them, and you can see how they'd react in ANY situation. Then try to let the kitten loose again, and see what they do.

Building interesting characters that hold the reader's attention and make me want to turn the page to see what they do next, is key to having stories that engage people and make them want to keep reading.

A good character - a crazy kitten - will help you make your story move forward, and make writing much more fun. Your story may not go where you were planning originally, but being surprised by your characters and having to corral the little bastards so they tell the story you want to tell makes a great story that readers can engage with.

idyvdg,Writing with Asperger's,"I was diagnosed a few years ago with Asperger's Syndrome. I had been writing for years before that, at first finishing projects at a respectable rate. Since I was diagnosed, my progress has for the most part ground to a halt.
During counselling my then counsellor told me that I couldn't be a writer, due to being autistic. Especially in relation to characters. Stating that because I was autistic, I couldn't write from different characters perspective. 

It had a great impact on my writing output and doubt in my own ability. The thing that I do struggle with is creating characters. Which makes me think that maybe my counsellor was right and that I can't be a writer. For the life of me, I can't seem to create characters that feel alive, or three dimensional. I've read numerous cases of writers talking about how their characters just come to life when writing. It's something that I haven't experienced in the slightest. 

I've tried using characters through wants and motivations, character sheets and many others. For whatever reason it doesn't work. As soon as I begin to write them they become bland and uninteresting. 

I can connect with characters from movies and books and want to see them grow and change throughout their stories. But yet, I can't seem to create characters that resonate with me, in the way characters created by other writers resonate with me. 

Which is odd, because there are times where an image will come to mind, of a character. And it's all there, how they look, sound, etc. However I can't transcribe any of it to the page. As soon  as I begin to, I lose the thread.

idgdla,"""I'm a pantser!"" Are you? Really?","First off, there's nothing wrong with being either a planner or a pantser.  Your approach to writing, whatever it is, is a perfectly valid approach.   

But I feel like a lot of people who are new-ish to writing declare themselves pantsers, and then end up on this subreddit asking for advice because they had this ""GREAT IDEA"" but they got two chapters in and have no idea what the story is and where it's going.    I think that for a lot of people, when someone first explains the planner/pantser idea to them, immediately declare themselves pantsers and launch in to writing.  Why?  Because pantsing sounds easier.   (Note: I did not say it IS easier!  Pantsing is actually really hard.)

""What, you mean I can choose between doing a bunch of boring planning or I can just leap into the fun stuff and start writing?  Oh, I am totally a pantser"".  

Sure, and maybe you are.  But maybe, if this is the fourth time you've written the first 3000 words of your story and then given up because you have no idea what is going on beyond the one cool scene you got from a dream, well, just maybe at that point you ought to consider spending some time trying planning.  At least something as basic as sketching out your story arc so you have a basic idea of where the story is going and why.

Now again, please don't turn this into some sort of pantser vs planner rant.  I just read several posts from people who haven't been able to get past the start of their story, but who rejected all advice that involved planning because ""I'm a pantser!"".   But maybe, if pantsing isn't working, you should try something different?

And of course, you could re-write this whole post the other way around....  if you're a ""planner"" who never actually starts writing because you're always planning, maybe you ought to just try some pantsing.

While I have the voice, character motivations, and general plot concrete in my mind, I’m finding myself struggling to make what is in some ways my own story interesting to others. In the plainest terms; I have no effing idea how to make a story of my experiences interesting enough to be an inspired piece of work enjoyable to others, and not just a lightly veiled narrative of my relationship with my sibling.

iebh1z,What is your opinion on size of the publishing company?,"This might be a weird question, but I don’t have a lot of writer friends so I’m hoping y’all might have some opinions.

I really want to go the traditional publishing route, I don’t have the time or quite frankly the motivation to self-publish. Seriously, if you self-publish, you’re a baller. I just don’t have the focus.

I recently got in contact with a small publishing company (like 5 to 10 books a year, they’ve only been around maybe 5 years) and they wanted to publish a novel I’ve been working on. It came as a bit of a shock, I only sent them a chapter or two for feedback and wasn’t expecting an offer. I’m ecstatic, but my friend pointed out that they’re pretty small and probably don’t have lots of reach.

It’s got me thinking though, as someone who isn’t looking to make a career out of writing, does the size of the publisher matter? Would you settle for a smaller publisher or take your chances on getting an agent? The novel isn’t finished yet, but they also haven’t finished drafting the contract, so I’ve got time. Would you take the first offer you got, especially if it might be the only one? I don’t want my excitement over someone liking my story to get in the way of exploring all my options, but I don’t want to be rude and query agents behind this publishers back, also taking the risk that no one else would enjoy it.

What would you guys do?

Edit: Seems like the general consensus is try the agent route because why not, but also be VERY weary of a publisher that does business this way. If anyone is interested, I’ll update y’all once I see the contract.",falling_awake_again,1,15,1598067370.0,2020-08-22 03:36:10

idqc2c,How I set aside time for writing,"I don't know who needs to read this but here it is.

One problem I have always run into as a writer is finding time to write. It's so easy to say ""just write"" but there's life to consider. There's work, family obligations, maintaining friendships, self care, etc. Personally, I think to myself throughout the day ""okay, today I'm going to write!"" then find an excuse to not write or even type out the shit I wrote in my notebooks. So, eventually, I got fed up and came up with a system that is currently working alright so far. 

1. Look at your schedule: If you have a set schedule, figure out your commute and time to get ready on top of your hours. If you don't have a set schedule, keep track of what kind of shifts you are usually scheduled. This also applies to school btw. Figure out the time you have free and work around your work. Remember, you have bills to pay. Don't blow off your day-job. 
2. Factor in your daily routine: Once you section off your work schedule, figure out what you have to do daily. I know it's the stereotype for writers to not look after themselves and it's so fashionable to be a walking trainwreck but you really do need to take care of yourself. How long does it take to shower? How much sleep do you need? How much time do you need to do basic chores? Do you need to take care of pets/kids? How much time do you need to meditate or center yourself? Trust me, you will thank yourself later if you make time to look after yourself. If you just throw yourself into the tortured artist mindset, you're going to burnout fast.
3. Look at the time you have left: After points one and two, look at the time you have left. Then ask yourself how much time will you need to write. This sounds silly since we'd ideally like to spend all of our spare time writing but we all know damn well that's not going to happen. Sometimes it takes a good twenty minutes to get in the mood, sometimes we need a sort of ceremony to complete before you get to it. The best thing you need to do is know yourself. Know your weakness and your own quirks. Then figure out a way to work with that.
4. Make rules for yourself: If you have trouble setting aside time in the first place, make rules for you to follow. Treat your procrastinating self like a bratty five-year-old. Set rules for yourself to follow and stick by them. If you have to set phone alarms to remind yourself or hang up signs around your room, do it. Do whatever you need to do to kick yourself in the pants and get to it. 
5. Set incentives: This is the big thing that works for me. If you really suffer from procrastination, sets a goal/incentive for yourself. What I do is pick out a particular vice that I'm guilty of and use that to motivate me. ""You cannot have a beer/glass of wine until you typed out the poems from your scrap notebook."" ""You cannot get a new comic book until you write the next chapter."" Use the reward system to your benefit if you have to. Remember: you are a grown up five-year-old; you will probably need to treat yourself as such. 
6. Set aside time to relax: This may sound counter productive but you need to set aside time to relax so that you don't burn out. What I normally do is that I work a little bit after work each work day then take one free day to get some major work done. Then I will use the remaining day/days (currently doing 10hr work days with 3 day weekends) to just relax. Read a book, binge on a series, or work on a home project you've been meaning to do for a while. You're brain is like any other part of the body; if you overwork it, you will eventually feel the pain. And if you push yourself too much, you will regret it later. Trust me.

And that's about it. I'm not going to get into specifics on how you should do it because a) what works for me might not work for you and b) this list might be bullshit to you. I understand. This is all just a suggestion for my working-class/busy writers who have been struggling to find the time to sit down and pound something out.

idymha,[beginner][advice] How to get started on writing essays as a hobby?,"Hola amigos,

Lately, I have gotten the creative urge to start writing essays as a hobby. My idea is to start a blog, make video essays on YouTube, or something of the like. However, as a fledgling writer, I want to start small before embarking on bigger projects. My writing is most likely mediocre as I have never made major efforts to improve upon it and develop my style (my writing was good enough to get A's for common core classes in college, which I'm sure is too low a bar to stop at). Thus, I am asking if any of you all have any suggestions for some beginner type writing projects to start on. On the other hand, if you all believe that diving into the deep end and just belting out raw essays would be better for my writing development, please let me know. I appreciate any help/insight from you all!

I finished my first draft of my (high fantasy) novel at the very beginning of summer, took a little break, and then started editing with the knowledge that there would be A LOT to fix, both with the plot and my writing technique. I started this book fairly young and a lot has changed since I started writing it.

After editing around 10 chapters I just gave in to what I didn't want to do and decided draft 2 will just have to just be a total rewrite. Theres no way around it as I'm cutting out major plot lines and a whole group of characters (possibly inserting more as well). 

In between draft 1 and 2 I DIDN'T reread the story over since I remember everything that's happened anyway. Since then, however, I've been experiencing a bit of a block in terms of deciding the true course of where I want it to go, how to go about writing it, etc. 

Now I'm wondering - was it actually necessary to read through draft 1 before starting draft 2? I'm honestly avoiding it, since I'm also kind mourning my old plot and characters. I feel like theres no way to rewrite it because THAT'S the story, even though I know it doesn't do it justice. I can't get this story out of my head... these characters out of my head. Ugh. How do I move on?

I'm currently working on editing the first draft of my first novel, a YA supernatural mystery. 

One of the things I'm struggling with is character agency. See, a major part of my protagonist's character arc is that she learns to become more confident and stand up for herself.

The unintended consequence of this is that she seems to not have much agency early on in the novel. She's under the influence of other characters and decisions she makes for herself often seem fruitless. 

The last thing I want is to have a passive or 'weak' protagonist. Is there anything I can do to give a character more agency from the get-go, whilst also showing her becoming more independent throughout the novel?",iveldi-61,7,8,1597998666.0,2020-08-21 08:31:06

idheu4,Would you write the story of the world?,"Hello writers,

I hope I respect the rules of this sub.

I build a website years ago for an idea I had. It was called the story of the world. The principle is simple :

There was the beginning of a story on the website. And it was asked to the visitors to write the next paragraph of the story. People could then vote for which paragraph they liked the most and that paragraph would be added to the story. Then people could write the next paragraph and the next and so on.

This is not a promotion post their are no links to a website or so. I'm just curious what you writers think about it? Would you participate to this big project about writing?

idaf7t,What should go on in the first chapter/first act of a novel?,"Hello friends.

I’m revising my novel and I’m stuck,  wondering if I should restructure my first chapter.
I feel like it’s a great exposition and relational setup of my characters, but I fear it MAY BE uneventful...

So my novel pretty much starts like this:
Ch.1 - intro to MC, antagonist and their minor conflicts.
Ch2. Return to MCs everyday life (school and friends and stuff), but also has him needing to return to antagonist for unfinished business.
Ch3. *inciting incident* MC discovers antagonist’s secret, grows sympathetic to antagonist and secret, and dives in to a world that will forever change his life and further the plot of the novel...

I hope that helps? It’s sci-fi (but not space opera, etc.) 

Again, I’m just not sure if the first chapter will keep you reading. 
I’ve had beta readers say that my flow is good in the first chapter and that that’s what made it easy to finish.
However, when they got to Ch. 2 and 3,  they said that that’s where my real story kicks off and that maybe I should start my story there...

So I rewrote the first chapter and pretty much jumbled all 3 chapters in 1, so that my first chapter will be eventful and not just exposition/setup. But I feel like it’s too rushed and readers won’t have a reason to care about the characters and their conflicts...

I may just be confused of where to put the inciting incident. Most say ASAP. Some say “when it’s right”. I tend to agree with both. 

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks 🙏🏽",diegoatl,16,15,1597930629.0,2020-08-20 13:37:09

ideohy,Using Voice Memos to Maximize Writing Productivity,"  

I’ve had a recent infatuation with voice memos to aid my writing process. I’m a firm believer that a writer’s experience is not measured strictly in the number of words they write. Any amount of our day may be spent consuming other content, whether that be media, news, or simply living, which would then be absorbed into our creative process. For this, boredom is a writer’s great friend, but how many of you had a good idea for a sentence, a scene or a bit of dialogue, and the next time you’re on the computer, it’s gone? It’s not bad enough that you’ve missed out on a potentially good idea, but remembering that there had been an idea in the first place is what really hurts.

In order to try to avoid this problem, I carry around a little black Moleskine notebook wherever I go. I’ve accumulated a whole mass of these which I’m sure will be valuable collector’s items when I inevitably (delusions of grandeur incoming) become a world-famous celebrity author who donates mementos of his career to charity auctions. I still stand by my little books, but recently I’ve found that voice memos are also an excellent option.

The biggest challenge in using memos is having to listen to the sound of your own voice, which probably for some people will be a show-stopper and honestly, I don’t blame you. That guy sounds effing weird. However, once I got over this particular hurdle and accepted that I don’t have a career in radio (or in podcasts, to use a more contemporary equivalent), voice memos have quickly become a staple of my writing process.

**The Equipment**

Many years ago I used to own a handheld dictation machine. I came into possession of such an item to try to deal with a bullying problem I experienced when I first arrived in Canada, which is a long story in and of itself but suffice it to say, having it in my pocket only worsened my bullying. In the years that followed, I occasionally dusted it off and tried to use it for my writing, but having to rewind the tape back and forth, and the aforementioned hang-up about hearing my own voice which I didn’t quite get over until I stopped giving a shit sometime in my thirties, it never caught on.

Now we’re living in an age far removed from my quaint magnetic tape dictation device. I don’t know about Android phones, but my iPhone comes with a handy Voice Memos app. It doesn’t do much, but it gets the job done. Scrolling through the recording is easy, as is recording over parts you’ve already recorded.

I wish it also came with the option of slowed-down replay, and I’m sure there’s other apps out there that can do just that, so I’m open to suggestions.

**The Process**

*The When*

Best part of using voice memos is that so many of your daily activities can be co-opted into the service of your writing. A common time for me to do this is while I’m washing the dishes in the evening – not exactly the most stimulating task, so my brain often goes into creative mode. Having a phone nearby to record thoughts makes sure that creative churning doesn’t go to waste.

A car is another place where the mind often wonders. Once I get to my destination, I spend a minute or two dictating everything I thought of on my way there before getting out of the car, and boom, writing done during a time that would otherwise have nothing to do with it.

Normally, when I go on my morning runs, I listen to audiobooks, but I imagine someone else might find it helpful to run these notes during exercise too.

The limits here are convenience of accessing a phone and your imagination, so make the best of it.

*The How*

I found that there’s two ways of using voice dictation to assist later writing: actual sentences and broad strokes.

Creating actual sentences is pretty self-explanatory – the writing is developed in my head, sometimes going through several iterations or part-sentences before it fully forms, and once I have the actual sentence, I record it with the voice memo, and move on to the next sentence.

Broad strokes, by contrast, doesn’t contain any usable writing. It sets the motions of the scene, the gist of what has to be said, but otherwise the actual writing process would need to occur at a later time.

Of course, what ends up happening is a bit of a mix. Sometimes a sentence doesn’t quite fall into place while the next one is bursting to come out, so I dictate a placeholder note. And sometimes when I intend to do a broader outline, a sentence just comes to me so I dictate it verbatim to not waste that little spark of creativity.

**The Transcription**

Depending on which method you use above, the transcription process is going to look different. With actual sentences, your role is pretty much just type out what you said, maybe editing here and there if you feel that with the benefit of hindsight that the writing could be better. This is perfect for those times when your muse is snoozing – might as well use your writing time productively without worrying what’s coming out onto the page. I’m a fairly decent typist, though I can’t keep up with my spoken speech – I tend to slow down my dictation if I have the opportunity, but sometimes I want to get it out fast and, in any case, I can never slow myself down enough.

For a broad strokes outline, the writing process itself will necessarily be a bit more involved – with creative writing being built on top of what was dictated earlier. In this case, speed of dictation matters less. Usually I play a prompt in its entirety and then set down to fleshing out the writing.

All-in-all, this method allows me to maximize the time I spend on writing activities and use my day more efficiently, especially since between a full-time day job and kids, those writing moments are precious and few.

Having extolled the virtues of voice memos, they will never fully replace my precious little black notebooks. Sometimes, you’re just not in a spot to whip out a phone and start talking into it. I may have less hang-ups about hearing my own voice but no one’s going to be listening to me dictate my creative writing on a busy bus, especially when it’s dialogue and it will look like I’m either trying to cover up that I’m talking to myself, or having a super weird conversation on the phone. Pulling a small notebook out of your pocket is far more discreet, even if I’ve been asked multiple times why I’m writing in my passport.

Also, writing in a notebook is far more user-friendly when you’ve got a random assortment of sentences and ideas that just need to be put down, rather than a single block of writing. These would be far easier to navigate in written form than in voice memos, and it also makes it easier to manage several projects at the same time.

As I was writing this entry, I was met with a cautionary tale that I feel obligated to share – I sat down to transcribe a four-minute voice memo, and discovered that it had somehow become corrupted, and all its content was erased. That was about an evening’s chores worth of ideas blasted out of existence. I managed to scrape out of my memory the gist of what I wanted to lay down, but not only was this an unnecessary double effort and therefore waste of time, but I know there were a few choice sentences there that were lost forever.

So I stand by everything I said above, but technology is technology and is often unreliable in the worst ways. Again, if there’s perhaps a more reliable voice memo app out there, I’m open to your suggestions.",MichaelSilverV,0,1,1597944458.0,2020-08-20 17:27:38

id9g7d,"What if the community that your stories most appeal to aren't who you want to advertise towards, but the work is easily dismissable by a more typical readership?","For context:

I suppose I'll say it immediately, but many of my works (both literary and artistically) involve anthropomorphised fauna and prominently feature inhuman, sapient life in carefully crafted settings of my own creation - while also being closer to life we're familiar with on Earth than pure alien exoticness. One of my settings even explores the nature of the concept of ""Humanity"", with individuals being unwillingly morphed into more animalistic forms that are pretty much describable as furries. 

But, there's a multitude of problems associated with my interest in such a subject, I suppose. I often interact with the furry community for my own reasons, but due to a combination of personal values conflicts and the public stigma around such individuals, I hold plenty of resentment and frustration at both sides. I guess, despite my own fondness for the subject I can't really associate with the furry fandom because it's typical subject matter (regular plain ol' anthropomorphic animals, usually with neon colours) don't always overlap with my fondness for fictional species creation that happen to be more human-like. Meanwhile, I hate how people often automatically discard 'furrier' works solely for being what they are, completely regardless of the amount of professionalism or polish, time and care that goes into the work itself. The amount of times I've heard people talking in comments about works that feature concepts I love with thoughts like, ""I wouldn't play that game because it feels like you're just playing as some creepy guy's fursona"" is incredibly disheartening as someone who wants to make a name for himself through auteur art and writing. I believe in my works and their quality, but seeing so many people dismiss characters or works outright for their content makes me wonder if there's any room for people like me.  

While there are works that have made names for themselves in even the mainstream sphere, it's always got a disclaimer attached onto it, like ""Beastars is *not* for Furries"" or the like compound the issue, as if the very concept is somehow automatically not worth people's time simply because of the existence of a fanbase. Zootopia gets a free pass because it's by Disney, a big company but I feel like for many smaller creators, there's a much bigger hurdle to cross. For that matter, I'm also not going to shy away from maturer topics such as sex or depravity, which is obviously going to raise some red flags given the content of the work itself. 

Ultimately, while I don't intend on *rejecting* such individuals from my works outright (because that's silly!), there's a heavy reluctance in directly marketing or advertising to them because it may bring in the more unfortunate individuals associated with such groups, or have the community centred around my works formed primarily out of such people, which is a scenario that would ultimately cause me to feel quite suffocated due to differences in paradigm. I want to bring in people from a wider array of backgrounds rather than just that one community, but I do not know if I'm able to accumulate that kind of 'outside appeal', since people reflexively reject more anthropomorphised designs on principle, regardless of the depth and quality of the work. I want to believe that, much like how male readers can sympathise with female characters, that humans can accept and be appealed to by inhuman characters in a similar fashion.

Is there a way in which I can try to create an 'image' for my works that lowers the entry bar for people and to uh, make it not look like a 'typical furry work' that people would immediately reject? Personally, I feel like a big part of that is the quality of the designs (which I hold confidence in too, so maybe that isn't so much of a problem) but in the literary format, that's not as directly 'doable' outside of the cover. I also have a feeling that (in terms of my fantasy series that shares similar properties to my other series) if I used the cover of my book to show off the designs of the species/characters in any artstyle *except* the classic 'fantasy gritty realism' look,that'll also turn off many people from it.

If anyone had any similar experiences, i would like to hear about 'em too.

EDIT: That said, my works *do* have classic humans in them, so it's not 'completely devoid' of characters like that, but they're only a part of the overall viewpoint.",anoxymo,2,20,1597926944.0,2020-08-20 12:35:44

I did the former for a major twist in book I'm getting critiqued now. At the time, the foreshadowing largely got misinterpreted as me making dialogue goofs or having scenes that amounted to filler. I got some praise when the twist came out, but I'm left wondering if I should have mentioned it ahead of time in case there was still some issue or another with any foreshadowing. Which approach is best?

Edit: I didn’t get into detail about what prompted this because I didn’t want to make it too long but I’ll do it now to avoid misunderstandings. I exaggerated how big the issue was. The specific instance that prompted this was a character who’s secretly a traitor slipping up on her act a few times before getting caught, and the scene that was assumed to be filler was her writing in a diary that proved her guilt later. Most of the feedback I described only came from one person who had no comment at all when the twist came. Two others had “Ohh!” And “Good job fooling me!” The fact the reaction was a bit mixed prompted me to ask this as a general question.",AsteroidBomb,1,21,1597934922.0,2020-08-20 14:48:42

I have a worldbuilding project (I will call it Kolgenista from now on), although not much of it is written down or concrete, it is quite expansive and has been developed in my head for over a decade and my dream has always been to actually make something out of it like a novel(la). Conveying my world and stories within it accurately and using quality work to others is important to me, so I don't want to start out writing a whole novel on the main story threads and characters and have it end up of poor quality and unread by anyone. I've already done plenty of reading and watching videos on the creative side of writing a story and building a world: countless articles, posts, and videos with advice on how to create a quality, believable and interesting world and story, but I'm really lacking in knowledge on the more technical aspect of writing. EI: I need help/advice with learning about the more technical/'physical' steps of actually coming up with drafts, character outlines, and whatever else would actually help me transfer the world and story from my head to the short story as the written word.

To hone my writing skills, expand and solidify my world, and hopefully find some readers to introduce and get interested/invested in my world before starting anything serious, I was hoping to start out on a manageable scale with 'supplementary' short stories which would all take place inside Kolgenista. My problem though is I haven't really tackled any writing projects that weren't given to me (ex: school work) - ones I'm fully in control of, so I'm having trouble deciding how and where to start. I'm having trouble deciding on the time, locations, and characters to set the story around, and I'd really like some advice (even in form of just links to tutorials/lessons) on how to begin, work on and finish a science-fantasy short story - specifically on how to create drafts, character outlines, etc, that would help the most in the actual technical writing aspect.

P.S.: I bet there are lots of similar posts here already which I will look at covering this topic, but if you can also help me out with learning of some great places where I would be able to share the short stories I finish. I'm thinking of making a website that has all my work on it to keep it all together, but I would need help getting them there from other sources and I wouldn't mind having an account elsewhere as well where I can post my full stories.  


P.P.S.: What are some great communities where people can share a part of their work (be it asking about world-choice, sentence/paragraph, character traits/description, or some plot choice) for advice or critique?

At first I was excited because I got the idea of this story, then I started writing full of passion and excitement. But in the middle of my writing, another idea suddenly popped into my brain. And the idea of the story was a fantasy because I always read some fantasy novel. And I'm starting to think it's gonna be my second story, and it's gonna work out after this. And yet it didn't help at all. 

First, I've been lazy to write mystery stories. Because I began to think that writing mysteries was as hard as it took high focus, and this is where I began to hate it when writing my first mystery book, whereas writing fantasies were also the same, but not as bad as I was writing mysteries. And second, I always thought of not continuing the mystery story I was working on and immediately writing down my second idea. But those two choices made me object.

I started asking my friend who was also a writer. My friend says ""if you hate it, why don't you just leave it? Besides, if you got the new idea and you like it, why don't you write it now? Leave it with your first story."" True, but his words made me object. Why would I write my mystery book for two months of self-sacrifice, and in the end, it didnt hit the library?

icntjz,How does working as a scenario writer (video games) or campaign setting writer (pen &amp; paper) differ from traditional novel publishing?,"While I've always dreamed of getting published as a novelist for a fantasy book, I've found my true talents are less in prose and more in world building and have often thought my skillset would be better adapted to a more flexible medium where I establish setting, lore, and history, and let others play out their stories, so a campaign setting like for a Pen &amp; Paper RPG or a scenario writer for a video game (admittedly some actual prose needed here, but more for writing dialogue as actions are depicted not described.)

Yet I often wonder how does one get into such a position? I was always under the impression that to be a writer for a video game you had to also have other technical skills related to software development, and likewise for a P&amp;P Setting you likely needed some familiarity and understanding of how to develop rulesets and tie them into your lore.

I've rarely heard of anyone breaking into these industries without being total indies who paved their own way by being multi-faceted talents, or already being well established names in other genres of publishing. I'm more curious what does it take to get noticed by already established companies? I understand you need some kind of portfolio, but what kind?

A traditional publisher is likely going to work very differently from a publisher of game books or a game development studio, so what does it take to really break into those fields? Can you do it solely off the merits of your writing alone or do you have to be well versed in other technical aspects?

As a secondary question, are there any other such opportunities where you can be published, or well known as a world-builder or scenario writer outside of gaming?",sbourwest,2,2,1597844389.0,2020-08-19 13:39:49
icgdpp,Bilingual book?,"I’ve considered writing a fictional story about moving from French-speaking Québec to the United States, largely based on my own experience, but I can’t find a way to get everything across without employing French. It’s not that I can’t express myself well enough in English (I think I’m better at English actually), it’s just that the best way to show someone adapting to a new language is showing the bridges that are built between the familiar language and the new language to be learned. 

Do I alienate audiences by including a different language? Where I’m from, it’s very common to find people fluent in both languages, but if no one else will be able to understand both parts, how can I accommodate for that in a book? Is it okay that the reader doesn’t understand some parts because of that language barrier?",ttwine,8,26,1597808809.0,2020-08-19 03:46:49
iccrdl,What's the name of this tone of voice?,"I just call it the ""dad voice"" because that's where I recognize and adopted it from. It's an authoritative kind of tone but also angry. It's like when someone remains calm, but you can feel anger in their voice despite their voice not raising in volume. Like when your parents scold you, but are calm. Emphasis will often be put on words such as ""What are you doing? No, stop. **Look** at me. **What** are you doing?"" 

It's basically like displaying anger/annoyance/displeasure without yelling and using tone and expressions to subtly signify that anger. The only word I can really describe is ""authoritative"" but I don't know if that does it justice.",ToesyToeNails,19,26,1597794929.0,2020-08-18 23:55:29
icpyl3,How to claim names of books or series name?,"I have a social media plan, to build up over the year or years as I work on my novel. I am going to get some commisioned art work for a title banner, maybe a character moment or two. 

Of course, the title banner would have the name of the book. Maybe, even the name of the series. 

Question is - should I? It's not copyrighted, and the book isn't even written yet, so, should I be putting stuff like that out there? Do you see any danger or reason not to?

Thank you for your feedback.",Calcaniest,1,27,1597851412.0,2020-08-19 15:36:52

icf7wa,The Unreliable Narrator: Forrest Gump-style,"Hello, I have an interesting narrative challenge I would like to discuss!

I recently realized (thanks to youtuber KrimsonRogue) that in movies like *Forrest Gump,* the narrator (Forrest) is unreliable, while the movie is revealing his lack of understanding to the audience. This is a strength of the visual storytelling mediums, but I think it can be done effectively in literature as well.

I know many stories have unreliable narrators, but often it seems the true version of events, or the bigger picture, is revealed some time after the initial telling. What I would like to discover and/or create, is a story in which the unreliability is revealed as close to the initial telling as possible, potentially even simultaneously, so as to achieve a similar effect as *Forrest Gump*. In the movie's case, it show's Gump's innocence and an obliviousness to/disconnect from society. The only example I can think of off the top of my head, that reveals the lies of intentionally dishonest characters, is Pinnochio in *Shrek 2*, proclaiming he doesn't wear ladies' underwear, only to be discredited when **(SPOILER)** his thong is revealed. Not that thongs are just for women, but it was 2004, and I digress.

I've come up with a couple of ideas to achieve this effect. One approach I can think of is to have multiple narrators, one with the ""truth,"" who is debunking the liar's narrative, though this could easily drift into the common realm of multiple POVs with different viewpoints. This might be further differentiated from the usual multi-POV by having an omnicient narrator present from the beginning, whereas Liar McWrong-pants's POV is introduced later on, encouraging the reader to believe the voice they're used to, once conflicting info is presented by someone else.

Another option is to reveal the truth of the setting, scenery, or actions, with descriptive language, in direct conflict with what the narrator is saying. This is the route I am leaning towards.

To avoid confusion, one could put the narrating character in first-person and ""the truth"" in 3rd, or any other variation. If using the approach of multi-narrator conflict, giving them very different voices is adviseable. As long as there's some kind of narrative difference between the sources of information, I think a myriad of approaches can be viable.

That's all I've got so far, and I'd like to know any examples you have of any media (movies included, but especially written stories) that make a point of calling the narrator on their BS.

What do you think of ""Forrest Gump narration"" when it comes to literature? Have you used it before or found effective instances of it? Do you have any other techniques to make it effective? Let's discuss!

Is it still fair to call yourself a writer?

ici91g,High school grad editing for a volunteering application,"Hi!

So as the title suggests, I have a bit of a task on my hands.  In exactly 25 hours, I've got a volunteering application due... one that needs an editing sample!  Thing is, I've never exactly edited writing before, but in response to my email, they told me a ""personal magazine edit"" works fine.  Now that you know the background info, here's my question—where should I look for a safe, yet fair text to edit?  Is there anything I need to know about editing?",JaimeCleopatra,3,0,1597817328.0,2020-08-19 06:08:48
ilc757,The editing process has made me want to stop writing,"I haven't done much writing lately, and while part of it is because I haven't had any success with being published in the last couple years combined with grad school eating up a lot of my time, I think the greatest reason has been because I just hate editing my work so much. I don't mean proofreading for grammatical and spelling errors, there just so many rules for things I'm expected to follow, like replacing adverbs with active verbs, limiting passive sentences, and reducing the use of words like ""was"" or ""were."" It's made writing feel like work because of this, and I probably haven't even finished anything in a few years.",lmjustdave,3,0,1599070603.0,2020-09-02 18:16:43
